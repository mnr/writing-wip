Life is so much easier to create nowadays.

Hephaestus crafted Talos, a giant bronze automaton. The robot was powered with *ichor*, the blood of the gods. Ichor is notoriously difficult to obtain and human contact results in instantaneous death. Be sure to wear personal protective equipment.

Dr. Frankenstein used a voltaic pile and mismatched cadavers. None of this was available from the hardware store: not the zinc, copper, or brine for the batteries and certainly not the cadavers. Zinc is difficult to make and cadavers in good condition are rare. His experiments constantly experienced supply-chain setbacks.

Craig Reynolds created a computer animation of a flock of birds in 1986. His success resulted in computer animation becoming the preferred platform for experimentation with artificial life: it doesn't require ichor, a voltaic pile, zinc, or cadavers. Hollywood, gaming, and pornography drove the creation of artificial life.

Seventy-four years later, Pali Hiapo creates life at her apartment in Montevideo, Uruguay. No zinc, no ichor, no cadavers, no robots. Just a computer. Pali doesn't need to create a physical being to create a usable being. Virtual behaviors in a virtual environment are just as good as physical behaviors in a physical environment. Banks, shopping, dating, religion. All just timed and coordinated electronic pulses across the ether. So much easier than servos, pistons, levers, wires, gears, and wheels.\
