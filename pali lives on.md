Life is so much easier to create nowadays.

Hephaestus crafted Talos, a giant bronze automaton. The robot was powered with *ichor*, the blood of the gods. Ichor is notoriously difficult to obtain and human contact results in instantaneous death. Be sure to wear personal protective equipment. *(1300 BCE)*

Dr. Frankenstein used a voltaic pile and mismatched cadavers. None of this was available from the hardware store: not the zinc, copper, or brine for the batteries and certainly not the cadavers. Zinc is difficult to make and cadavers in good condition are rare. His experiments constantly experienced supply-chain setbacks. *(AD 1818)*

Craig Reynolds created a computer animation of a flock of birds. His success resulted in computer animation becoming the preferred platform for experimentation with artificial life: it doesn't require ichor, a voltaic pile, zinc, or cadavers. Hollywood, gaming, and pornography drove the creation of artificial life. *(AD 1986)*

Pali Hiapo creates life at her apartment. No zinc, no ichor, no cadavers, no robots. Pali doesn't need to create a physical being to create a usable being. Virtual behaviors in a virtual environment are just as good as physical behaviors in a physical environment. Banks, shopping, dating, religion. All just timed and coordinated electronic pulses across the ether. Its so much easier than using servos, pistons, levers, wires, gears, and wheels. *(AD 2063)*

All software projects start small. A small software project in 2063 wouldn't have been considered small in 1994. When released in 1994, Linux filled 352,500 bytes of memory, just a bit shorter than *Lord of the Flies*. Pali's small starting project is roughly twice the length of *War and Peace.*

Pali initiates the program and a cartoonish face appears in her visor. It floats, virtually, like a spouse sitting across the breakfast table. The face's androgynous mouth moves, speaking quotes from the *I-Ching* in a generic tenor voice. It took Pali fifteen minutes to produce this experiment. She doesn't bother to speak to it or examine the facial detail. This is just a *Hello World*.

But the size of the project is irrelevant. At any size, her project would be problematic. Illegal, depending on the location of the physical server hosting the code. Pali is a Professor at the Universidad de Montevideo, lecturing on Autonomous Robotics in the School of Engineering. Uruguay encourages software research, short of performing corporate penetrative testing across international boundaries. Pali is clear of legal restraints.

Pali links in a machine learning library and instructs it to draw from the online presence of a former lover: Jupyter Fuertes. Jupyter lives in Portland Oregon with Avery, a new boyfriend. Pali is convinced, *hopeful*, that Avery is a temporary distraction.

**[Why is Pali doing this? Why is she obsessed with Jupyter?]**

Data flows in like a blood transfusion and the cartoon face softens. Pores appear in the skin and the complexion darkens. The face becomes female, her hair darkens. Her eyebrows arch and her cheeks become fuller.

More pleasing to Pali, possibly alarming to others, the floating Jupyter stops quoting the *I-Ching* and begins repeating phrases spoken by Jupyter. The texture of her voice approaches, then mimics Jupyter.

"q [**substitute these with Jupyter quotes from Stupid Machine**]{.ul} e," says the virtual Jupyter mimic. "q [**substitute these with Jupyter quotes from Stupid Machine**]{.ul} e."

Pali grabs the floating head and "sticks" it to the table. She holds her finger to the lips of the head to mute the voice. When she walks away, the head remains behind, silent but still animated. Pali leaves it to continue learning: the mouth moves and the face assimilates features of Jupyter. Below the head, a neck sprouts, then shoulders. It is like a plant growing from the top-down, sending out a descending wireframe with resolution improving from the neck and rougher towards the feet.

[PALI DOES SOMETHING HERE, THEN RETURNS TO JUPYTER]

[PALI ADDS MORE SOFTWARE TO THE JUPYTER SIMULATION]

Jupyter is back to reciting the *I-Ching*, but with Jupyter's tone and accent. This might seem innocent, but this is the division between legal and illegal. The first version of this virtual Jupyter was only a puppet replaying video clips from recordings Jupyter made herself. The *I-Ching* version of Jupyter is sampling random phrases, then modifying them to match how Jupyter would perform them.

"A quiet-hearted person awakes with a smile on his lips and an eagerness in his heart for the day ahead." Jupyter would never have said this. But in Pali's visor, that is exactly what Jupyter is doing.

But it's not convincing. Jupyter doesn't use these words. The simulation tries again:

Pali does a double take. Like Dr. Frankenstein looking over his shoulder at the night watchman.
