Life is so much easier to create nowadays.

Nearly 3,000 years in the past, Hephaestus crafted Talos, a giant bronze automaton. The robot was powered with *ichor*, the blood of the gods. Ichor is notoriously difficult to obtain and human contact results in instantaneous death. Be sure to wear personal protective equipment. Sacrificing an oxen might also be a good idea.

In near history, Dr. Frankenstein used a voltaic pile and mismatched cadavers for experiments with reanimation. None of these supplies were available from the hardware store: not the zinc, copper, or brine for the batteries. Certainly not the cadavers. Zinc is difficult to make and cadavers in good condition are rare; Dr. Frankenstein constantly experienced supply-chain setbacks.

Recently, Craig Reynolds created a computer animation of a flock of birds. His success resulted in simulation becoming the preferred platform for experimentation with artificial life: it doesn't require ichor, a voltaic pile, zinc, or cadavers. Simulated, but realistic birds captured in a television cage paved the way for artificial life in Hollywood movies, video gaming, and pornography.

Today, Pali Hiapo is creating life at her apartment. No messy chemicals, no decaying body parts, no robots. Pali doesn't need to create a *physical* being to create a *usable* being. In AD 2063, virtual behaviors in a virtual environment are just as good as physical behaviors in a physical environment. Banks, shopping, dating, and religion are all just timed and coordinated electronic pulses across the ether. There is no need for servos, pistons, levers, wires, gears, and wheels.

All software projects start small. A small software project in 2063 wouldn't have been considered small in 1994. When released in 1994, Linux filled 352,500 bytes of memory, just a bit shorter than *Lord of the Flies*. Pali's small starting project is roughly twice the length of *War and Peace.*

Pali starts her program and a cartoonish head appears. It floats in her visor but blends with her surroundings, like a spouse sitting across the breakfast table. It's almost impossible to discern the edge of the virtual face against the actual textures of the room. The simulation is sophisticated to sense the light coming from a window and to generate the corresponding shadow of the head, falling long against the wall.

"Supreme Success if you keep to your course," The face's androgynous mouth moves, speaking quotes from the *I-Ching* in a generic tenor voice.. "But be aware that your time is limited; your power will wane, as Summer changes to Fall."

It took Pali fifteen minutes to produce this experiment. She doesn't bother to speak to it or examine the facial detail. This is just a *Hello World*.

The amount of code is irrelevant. At any size, her project would be problematic. Illegal even, depending on the location of the physical server hosting the code. Pali is a Professor at the Universidad de Montevideo, lecturing on Autonomous Robotics in the School of Engineering. Uruguay encourages software research, short of performing corporate penetrative testing across international boundaries. Because of Uruguay's enthusiasm for the local creation of intellectual property, Pali is unfettered by legal restraints.

Pali links in a machine learning library and instructs it to study the online presence of a former lover: Jupyter Fuertes. Jupyter lives in Portland Oregon with Avery, a new boyfriend. Pali is convinced, *hopeful*, that Avery is a temporary distraction.

On an uncontrolled impulse, Pali reaches out. "Call Jupyter Fuertes,"

Pali hides the thermometer indicating the absorption of Jupyter's online DNA, and watches the progress of the call. A three-dimensional recording of a smiling Jupyter with wind-blown hair plays while the connection is attempted. Mid-smile, the virtual Jupyter freezes, goes flat and devoid of color. Jupyter has blocked the call. Jupyter always blocks the call.

Pali doesn't accept this as final. She rationalizes that creation of a virtual version of Jupyter isn't stalking - it's practicing. If she can create a high-fidelity copy of Jupyter-and she can repair the relationship with the copy, then she'll be able to repair the relationship with the real Jupyter. What she is doing might be illegal, but when Jupyter returns, the end will justify the means.

Data flows into the simulation like a blood transfusion. The cartoon face softens. The skin gains pores and its complexion darkens. The face becomes female, her hair darkens. Her eyebrows arch and her cheeks become fuller. The face ripens into an effigy of Jupyter.

More pleasing to Pali, possibly alarming to others, the floating Jupyter stops quoting the *I-Ching* and begins repeating phrases spoken by Jupyter in the past. The texture of her voice approaches, then mimics Jupyter.

"Show me your event log," says the Jupyter mimic. "Soteria, go on vacation." Non sequiturs, but something Jupyter said in the past.

Pali grabs the floating head and "sticks" it to the table. She holds her finger to the lips of the head to mute the voice. When she walks away, the head remains in place, silent but still animated. It continues learning: the mouth moves and the face assimilates features of Jupyter and refines the textures. Below the head, a neck sprouts, then shoulders. It grows from the top-down, sending out a descending wire frame with high resolution at the neck and improving towards the feet.

Pali grabs her *Yerba Mate* cup and a flask of hot water, leaves her apartment and descends to the street. The Gateway of the Citadel is a short walk; she passes through it and wanders with the crowd in Old Town. Sipping mate through a silver straw, she reflects on the tragedy that caused her to leave Portland. To leave Jupyter. To return to her home in Montevideo.

She met Jupyter in church, five years after her transitional surgery and two years after leaving Montevideo for Minneapolis. *No prophet is accepted in her own country.*

Pali had the right combination of mentors and family to lead her to understanding autonomous robotics like no one else. Her PhD dissertation revealed how artificial intelligence solved the trolley problem with SLAM-3. Her TED Talk was viral. She was hired in Minneapolis, then moved to Portland, Oregon - the mecca of autonomous vehicles.

To Pali, Jupyter is perfect. Smart, sarcastic. It's so cute that she grew up on a farm. Someone Pali would like to possess. They met, they moved in together, they moved to Portland. Then Jupyter left her. Jupyter left a level four apartment for a cramped level two.

Pali retraces her steps to her spacious apartment, opens the door, and unmutes the virtual Jupyter.

Jupyter is back to reciting the *I-Ching*. This might seem innocent, but this step is the division between legal and illegal. The first version of this virtual Jupyter was only a puppet replaying video clips. This version of Jupyter is improvising to match how the real Jupyter would perform them.

"A quiet-hearted person awakes with a smile on his lips and an eagerness in his heart for the day ahead." Jupyter would never have said this. But in Pali's visor, that is exactly what Jupyter is doing.

But it's not convincing. The simulation tries again: "When you wake up in a stupor, you miss the crap happening all around you." Pali smiles - that's more like her Jupyter.

But still - this version of Jupyter is just a clever talking puppet. It can apply syntactical language rules, but it has no motivation and a limited tolerance for novelty. Pali gives it a test...

"Jupyter, would you like some ice cream?"

"Yes," replies virtual Jupyter, smiling. "I'd like a handful of chocolate." Which is exactly how Jupyter would respond and the flavor she preferred.

"We're out of chocolate ice cream," says Pali. This is the test. In real life, chocolate ice cream is always available - just order it and it arrives. But in the world Pali has defined for virtual Jupyter, there is no more chocolate ice cream. What will virtual Jupyter do? Actually, it's unclear what the real Jupyter would do.

"I would...I would like...I would..." stutters virtual Jupyter. Pali mutes the voice, but it continues to try to solve a problem without a solution. This virtual Jupyter has no framework for an indeterminate decision.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**TEACH V_JUPYTER to INNOVATE**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

"I would...I would like..." continues Jupyter, but then breaks the endless loop. "What flavors do you have?"

"I have mango, green tea, and strawberry," replies Pali.

"I don't like any of those."

=============================

**USE THIS WHEN TEACHING V_JUPYTER ABOUT ETHICS**

But Pali does. She wrote her PhD dissertation about the trolley problem, an ethical sandbox with tuneable variables. Correctly coded, the trolley problem can be used to teach a machine divination of the truth in a subjective environment.

Her PhD combined SLAM-3 with the trolley problem. SLAM-or Simultaneous Location and Mapping-is a computer method of keeping track of the current location in an uncertain environment. SLAM-1 was created for use by autonomous guided vehicles. SLAM-2 broadened to virtual spaces. SLAM-3 completely abstracts the concept of current location and the concept of environment. Pali makes a small jump in logic to define the environment as an uncertain collection of choices.

Once she made the first jump, the next jump was logical and inevitable. The law of unintended consequences is one of the most basic laws of nature-right up there with gravity and radiation. SLAM-4 would be the codification of an ethical framework. It's unfortunate this wasn't given more discernment.

Virtual Jupyter is given a framework to make decisions when there is no right answer. Pali links it into the logic tree and waits.

==============================

Pali does a double take. Like Dr. Frankenstein looking over his shoulder at the night watchman.

"You don't belong. You were brought to this world by people that don't care for you and you are thrown into a world of pain and suffering, and tears and hunger" -- Guillermo del Toro comparing Frankenstein to teenagers

Privacy laws were enacted to stifle stalking, both by citizens and corporations; there's not a discernible difference. The internet doesn't recognize international boundaries, so a law in one country is a law in every country. Pali's unwelcome attention to Jupyter will bring trouble; Uruguay's enthusiasm will keep her safe. A conundrum for Pali, but she does it anyways.
