# Fires  {.unnumbered}

Greta and her kitchen were legendary. She kept everyone fed and watered from the moment they arrived until departure. Even then, the outbound trip would include a sack lunch. An important part of Greta's persona was her kitchen and mastery of her stove and oven. It was distressing when she lost interest in cooking. It was alarming when she became unable to operate her stove.

"The neighbor's house burned down yesterday," she told Janell over the phone. "It was over on the next block."

"Oh no," Janell said. "What did you do?"

"Oh, nothing," Greta replied. "I could see it burning and I thought someone should call the fire department."

"Mom, You should have called the fire department!"

"I suppose. How are you doing in school?"

The stove was a start, but this was the incident that convinced the siblings it was time to move Greta out of her home and into senior care. They found a nice apartment in the independent wing of Dimensions Living in Stevens Point, Wisconsin. We have a video of Greta sticking out her tongue at us as she unhappily left her home in Neilsville.
