# Harassing The Natives {.unnumbered}

Now that I'm a resident, I'm allowed to loiter in the hallways, and I frequently do so outside Greta's door, located on the main avenue between assisted living and the dining room. There is a lot of foot traffic. To my left, I see Gladice approaching, pushing her walker. I'm in a frivolous mood and I call her out.

"Young lady," I bellow. "Do you have a hall pass? I think you should be in class, and if you don't have permission to be out here, you'll have to report to the principal's office!"

Gladice is shorter than five feet, I'm taller than six. She has a curved spine and has to turn her head upwards to stare me in the eye.

"I think you can stick it in your..." Gladice pauses for a beat, then continues. "...ear. You can stick it in your ear!"

She is clearly considering a different orifice, but chooses a more discrete option. I'm shocked, I say. SHOCKED to hear such a big thing come from such a small woman. We smile and she is on her way.

Later she stops by to ask forgiveness for her spicy response. Janell steps in, saying "Gladice, you said exactly the right thing. You're my new best friend." I'm being ganged up on by the women - deservedly so.

When she's not telling me to stuff it, Gladice is morose. Her body is failing and she is ready for the Lord to call her home, a common euphemism for a merciful death. I kneel down at her table in the dining hall, place my left arm on the back of her chair, my right hand on her arm, and I look her in eyes. She has my full attention and I listen as she tells me what she hopes for.

Once she told me about the "Blue Top Restaurant." Her husband would take her there on special occasions. I gather they had a passionate relationship. She is refined and doesn't share details, but I'll bet with a bit of prodding I could get some steamy tales. I resolve to take her back to the restaurant as a special treat.

When I find it on the internet, it has a one-star review with pictures of a semi-abandoned building with peeling paint and surrounded by chain link fences. It is a grimy shadow of the restaurant she remembers and I cancel my plans. The Blue Top Restaurant has a better existence in Gladice's memories.

I'm becoming a personality at Dimensions Living. I hang out in the halls, I play Rummikub in the community room, I eat meals. I have an expansive sense of humor and they enjoy my enthusiasm. I have friends here.

On Saturdays, sons and daughters take my friends out to dinner. I sit outside the front door, enjoy the sun, and wave as they drive off. If I'm still sitting outside when they return, residents will often join me. Sons and daughters say their goodbyes and go back to their lives.

I have the pleasure of enjoying a sunset with someone who knows how few sunsets remain to them and how precious every morning can be. We don't talk about their lunch or their children.
