# What Others are Saying about My Favorite Mother-In-Law

> *I wholeheartedly enjoyed this book! We get a glimpse into the life of a wonderful woman named Greta and the light-hearted antics of living in a retirement home from the view of her favorite son-in-law. He touched on religion throughout the book with such levity, it was honestly refreshing! Beautifully written!*

> *This book will have you laughing and teary eyed. What an adventure Mark and Janell have with Greta I really like reading about the red chair, also about Ruby at first I didn’t understand why Greta was not friendly with Ruby, not giving anything away. Than the pictures heist this was funny to me. I believe you will enjoy this book as I do. I will reread this book again*

> **Fabulous aging/end of life story**
>
> *This is a book in which one can laugh at the same words that could cause tears. Everyone gets older one day at a time. But when do we really take the time to reflect on all of the bygone years, and recognize that we are now at the “old” age that was once reserved for our aunts and uncles and grandparents?*
