# The Siblings {.unnumbered}

Greta and Gene raised five children: three girls, two boys. There were more conceived, but these ended in miscarriages and Gene and Greta picked up the pieces and moved on.

I'm told I had an additional older sister. There were complications, and a doctor told my parents they were done having children. I'd like to meet this doctor and review his methodology, general knowledge, and conclusions.

Janell and I have two children, both of whom were enthusiastically welcomed. At one point in our early lives, we were traveling for several months. Janell's period was late, so we went to a Seattle planned parenthood for a pregnancy test. Apparently this was before the day of a drugstore pee-on-a-stick.

Janell provided whatever fluids the clinic requested, then we sat in the waiting room. Strangely, I don't remember discussing the impact a pregnancy would have on our trip, much less our lives.

"Janell, you can come in now," the nurse said. "First door on your right."

We walked in, closed the door, sat down. Again, I can't remember our conversation while we waited. But I do remember the excitement. Our approach to travel is dealing with the unexpected and finding the enjoyment of the moment. This was another unexpected event; we would find the enjoyable path through.

There was a small knock at the door and a woman in a lab coat enters, accompanied by the nurse. She has a piece of paper. This part of my memory plays out like a reality show reveal, where there is a dramatic statement ("And this week's star baker is...") followed by reaction shots of several faces, followed by the verdict ("...MARSHA!")

"Well, Janell," the white coat says, "you're...."

\[insert dramatic reaction shots; Janell. Mark. The nurse. Everyone in the waiting room. The fictional film crew.\]

"...not pregnant!"

Janell and I express disappointment. We were ready for an adventure. We were ready for a pregnancy. Not today.

"That's not the usual reaction," says the white coat. "Most people are relieved or happy to hear this. I guess, well, I'm sorry?"

We held hands and walked out the door. I'm not sure we told our travel friends.

Janell and I have never experienced a miscarriage in our personal lives. Janell, as a midwife, has experienced many, as well as the heartbreak of fetal demise. I'm part of Janell's support network, so I vicariously experienced her grief.

I believe Greta loves her five children with the extra capacity of those two miscarriages. Gene was a quiet man, but I know he did as well. I saw him demonstrate this love in quiet ways.

Janell brought me home to meet her parents one holiday. At the end of the visit, we loaded up the Buick Skylark (Engine: V6, one hundred and fifty-five horsepower, paint: blue, rust: yes, mpg: \[see *Engine* above\]) and drove to the gas station to say goodbye to Gene. We drove over the bell cable (*ding ding*) and Gene came out. He filled the gas tank, checked the oil, forgot to charge us, said goodbye. When I got back in the car I could see he was holding back tears. I don't think that was part of the everyday service he offered to other customers.

Greta's children have dispersed themselves across the United States. The oldest son one lives eight miles from Dimensions Living; Janell lives 1,944. Siblings number three, four, and five are respectively overseas, sixty-seven miles, and 1,055 miles. Likewise, the siblings are at different points in their careers; the younger they are, the less flexible their job. Personal visits become more difficult as distance increases or a career demands.

They love her in their unique ways. One son fiercely protects her religion. One daughter shows her pictures. Another son sings her songs. Another daughter fixes her hair. All visit and call on a regular basis.

But providing twenty-four by seven rehabilitation care is a big ask. Professional rehab nurses are difficult to find and expensive, and for a good reason. It's unrealistic to ask anyone to give up family, life, and career.

Janell and I decided to take on the job. Our lives are flexible and we have the freedom to relocate at whim.

Greta needing care was just another unexpected event; we would find the enjoyable path through.
