# Nickel Bingo {.unnumbered}

On Sunday, a weekly activity guide appears in my mailbox. Fitness class is on Monday at 1:00 p.m. The Catholics among us recite the Rosary at 2:30 on Wednesdays. Ice cream is just before the Rosary.

That's all very nice, but how we *long* for bingo night.

## Important Things

*Nickel Bingo is every Thursday at 6:00 p.m.*

There are two notable parts of this sentence. Lesser, but still significant, is the time: Nickel Bingo happens at 6 p.m. Activities occurring past 5:00 p.m. are *late-evening*. ~~Supper~~ ~~Dinner~~ Supper is served from 4:30 to 5:30 p.m.; after that, the halls become the domain of the night owls. Any resident gatherings after six feel surreptitious. Walk unannounced into one of the activity rooms and you may find residents quietly playing Rummikub, but that's just to avert suspicion; when you move out of earshot, they will resume plotting world domination.

Before living here, these late-nighters huddled around the corner table in a seedy bar, speaking in lowered voices and pausing their planning when the server came by to refill drinks. After I have lived here for a month, they trust me a bit. But they still change conversation when I approach.

At six o'clock on Thursday evenings, the late-nighters forego Rummikub and move to the Independent Dining Room for *nickel bingo*.

## Nickel Bingo

Nickel Bingo is the second notable thing in the above sentence. There are *other* games during the week, notably candy bingo and jewelry bingo, but these are minor-league compared to nickel bingo. If you win at candy or jewelry bingo, you get to choose a piece of candy (or a piece of jewelry). But, *you don't put anything in the cup to play*. You can show up empty-handed and still win. The bingo sharks participate in these lesser events, but only as a side to the big event on Thursday evening.

Very few men show up for candy or jewelry bingo. I asked the activity coordinators if there is ever gun, fishing lure, or whiskey bingo. (answer: *no!*) I've thought of organizing an underground bingo association for the men; the poorly lit basement garage would be ideal for a cigar-smoking, scotch-drinking Friday night game. So far, I’ve abstained from instigating this clandestine event. I don't want to be the cause (or subject) of an *official memo* on inappropriate evening activities.

## Official Memos

```         
Official memos come from the Facility Director and appear in your campus mail slot; sometimes posted in the elevator. The memo vaguely insinuates a precipitating situation, but the intent is clear: 

"Keep it up, buster, and your children will interview other residence halls for your next placement."
```

## Games

In my family, games were a thing to do with your hands while we socialized. In the Ross family, games are serious. "*Are you going to talk, or are you going to play?*" They here to win. After a few rounds, I realize I don't have the level of competitiveness required. So I watch and make irreverent commentary from the sidelines.

Greta will happily play cribbage well past my bedtime. She's quick, recognizes the points for certain combinations of cards and announces her score after a glance. Apparently it's an automatic reflex, like breathing or heart beats or flinching away from the strong coffee I make.

Lately, we've noticed her count is wrong. She accidentally double counts (But not on purpose. Gene would do it to see if we were paying attention.)

Instead of cribbage, I take Greta to community bingo. She misses some of the called numbers, but I back her up. We like hanging out together more than playing bingo.

## Bingo Basics

General bingo knowledge will help you understand the drama associated with nickel bingo. I'll make this as brief as possible, after which I'll explain why our quiet little games frequently descend into mayhem.

Explained simply, bingo is a game of drawing a straight line through five random numbers on a grid. A caller selects those numbers, then players mark them if they are on their card. When the marks form a row or column, the player calls out "BINGO." Everyone expresses amazement, and the game is reset.

Players select a bingo card from a stack. I don't believe you can bring your own card. This isn't like pool where you own a custom-made stick. Private cards, at the least, would be a topic of conversation for weeks; at worst, it would be the cause of another *official memo*.

## The Player Table

Our players agreed on assigned seating, even though an *official memo* discouraged this behavior. Visitors might consider sitting at the room's periphery to avoid crashing this unspoken tradition. If you can't find a seat, you should just watch, rather than cause a disruption. I earned the position of honored guest and am invited to join one of the regular tables.

Each player has two bingo cards. (I could play more, but two is the norm. And I've learned to stick to the norm. Mostly. Occasionally. *It's complicated*.)

A small bowl sits in the middle of our table. It might be empty or it might contain change. At the beginning of each round, we contribute one nickel per card, placing the coins in the bowl. Two cards, two nickels. Therefore, we call this game nickel bingo. Four people at the table times two cards results in eight nickels in the bowl. Which equals forty cents. Instead of two nickels, we may deposit one dime. If someone deposits a quarter, they can remove fifteen cents.

If I forget my jar of nickels, I sponge off Greta. She’s gracious, but I worry this will strain our relationship. Her change includes quarters, dimes, pennies, and sometimes dollar bills. A side note: for God’s sake, don’t bring foreign currency. This would precipitate another *official memo*.

Before I remove money from the bowl, I am *inordinately* clear about my action and intention. Someone might misconstrue sudden movement. Fortunately, weapons are not allowed in our building.

## Game Phase One—The Collection

Before each round of bingo begins, the designated money collector circulates among the tables and gathers coins from each bowl. We assume the collector confirms each table has contributed the correct amount (*but maybe not. More on this in a minute*). Coins are placed at the head table and the bingo caller proceeds.

Collecting fees must be done with efficiency. Everyone waits for the game to begin, but not patiently. Pick up the bowl, count the change. This should be simple enough.

*But not so fast...*

You might think collection is an inconsequential job, but it is not. An informal and self-designated sub-committee of residents bestows the honor of collector upon an individual. The qualifications are not available for public review anywhere that I've seen, but I believe the main qualifier is squeezing between tightly packed tables, walkers, and wheelchairs. This requires the ability to bend your knees and locomote without support. I am proud to note I was asked to perform this task and discharged my duties with the earnestness of a first-time student council president.

Now—-I propose a conundrum for you to consider. *What is the proper response if the change is not correct for the number of bingo cards visible on the table?*

The obvious strategy would be to ask if everyone has contributed. When I'm fortunate, one member will realize it is time to ante-up and contribute their fair share. Unfortunately, this rarely happens.

It's probable someone miscounted when they made change; a quarter in the bowl is an indicator. Miscounted change is exacerbated by the cumulative arthritis of everyone at the table. Arthritis is when your knuckles grind bone-on-bone. To develop empathy, insert 60-grit sandpaper between each joint in your fingers so it is excruciating to bend them, then wrap each finger in duct-tape so you cannot flex. Now, try to pick up three nickels placed in a small bowl to make change for your quarter.

In all cases, I've found it easiest to agree everything is accurate, then pour this bowl into the general collection. This isn't an IRS audit and the amount to be won is secondary to the win itself. Smile and move on.

During my training to become certified as a bingo money collector, I also learned of the inadvertent donation timing confusion. Here's a scenario:

1.  I arrive at the table and develop empathy with the players. I assure them they will win during this round. They assume I am lying to gain their favor, which is true.

2.  Someone needs change, most likely for a dollar. I make change from the bingo fees I've already collected.

3.  I reach to collect the bowl. In this scenario, someone will object; "You already collected for this round."

I am *certain* I have not collected. But I am only one vote out of five, the other four being the players seated at the table. They assume the bowl contains money for the next round. The act of making change interrupted the normal interaction between players and the collector. Or sadly, their short-term memory is a bit wobbly. Untangling this error is torturous. I tried to reason through a narrative of the collection, but there is no point to this. Again—smile. Move on.

Someone may not contribute or is flustered with the quick flow of money across the table. I learned to carry a supplemental pocket of nickels and make a lightning loan where necessary. *"I've got you covered,"* I tell my new friend. In a few minutes, everyone forgets about the loan, but the friendship remains. I count that as a win.

As you might realize, collections became an issue of major contention and even made it to a topic of discussion at a town hall. Volunteers stepped up with a plan; now we have a collection system inspired by the traditions of the Lutheran Church.

## Game Phase Two—The Calling

After the collection, the bingo caller proceeds with the announcing of numbers. Again, let me explain the simple concept, then the nuances that lead to shouting.

## Bingo Caller Certification

```         
You might think I am kidding about bingo caller certification. I am not. Depending on location, you may be required to take a class, pass a test, and/or annually renew your license. Search the internet for "bingo certification" for details.
```

To start, the caller draws one ball from a bucket of 75 and announces the letter/number combination ("G-48. That's GEE...FOUR...EIGHT), then—and this is important—places that ball in a master matrix. With the ball safely in place, the caller repeats the process. The matrix is an easy way to confirm which numbers have been called. Which is important when someone calls...

**BINGO!**

### What could go wrong?

#### The Caller

Qualities of a good bingo caller include enunciation, volume, and pacing. This is much like an auctioneer, but slower. There is such a thing as lightning bingo—but not here.

Ideally, the caller will draw a ball from the bucket, then call out the number clearly and carefully, pause, repeat the letter and number, place the ball in the matrix, pause, shuffle the balls, and draw another.

However, some callers forget their training and gain bad habits: Speaking softly. Sloppy pronunciation. Calling too fast. When auditioning a caller, we favor experience as pastor, square-dance caller, sports announcer, elementary school teacher, or game-show host. Unfortunately, the qualification of the caller is not the only chaotic force in action.

Pacing is every bit as important as volume and enunciation. As we age, our brains suffer a reduction in processing speed. When I was twenty-years-old, I could do math in my head. I could also perform deep-knee bends while lifting seventy-pound weights. Forty years later, math takes longer and my knees support less weight. Pausing between bingo calls gives everyone a chance to hear the number, parse the number, check both bingo cards, slide the plastic cover, wiggle the cover if it sticks, confirm the number with a neighbor, check for a bingo pattern, and re-focus to prepare for the next call. Bingo players don't like it when callers move too fast.

#### Rattle

About those damn bingo balls. They are plastic; every time the caller stirs the bucket of balls, they generate noise akin to a ball-bearing factory. It masks human speech. If they don't pause long enough between calling the number and stirring the balls, we hear the following...

> "O-63...that's O- (RATTLERATTLERATTLE). The next number is B-3. That's B- (RATTLERATTLERATTLE)."

RATTLERATTLERATTLE causes a cascade of secondary noise, caused by one or more calls to repeat the last number, followed by some of the bingo players repeating the number (out of sync, so the response is also confused) followed by the bingo caller demanding silence, which is followed by more bingo players again asserting the latest number simultaneous to a different group of players asking if it was a different number, followed by the caller repeating the number, followed by someone asking if that is the last number or the next number. Simultaneously, there is background rumbling about the caller being inaudible or the players needing to pay better attention.

Also problematic are outsiders: relatives, children, nursing staff, janitors. Relatives and children are the worst, as they have no respect for the sanctity of the game in progress. Typically, they appear at the door, squeal, and call out; "GRANDMA! WE'RE HERE!" They invade our sanctuary en masse, surround their relative and talk loudly about their *car trip* and *how good it is to see them* and *how big the kids have grown* and *we have this pie we baked for you* and *what's going on here* and *Oh, I love bingo* and *we should join in*.

I'm enthusiastic about visitors. They brighten up everyone's day. But *gawdammit*, we're trying to play **bingo** here. ***Nickel Bingo!***

Likewise, the nursing staff will sometimes stop by for blood pressure and pulseOx. They truly are heroes and wrangle medications with grace and care. But the brief interruption in game play means possibly missed numbers, causing one or more calls to repeat the last number, followed by some bingo players repeating the number ... and so on.

The maintenance team tries to be quiet, but sometimes they vacuum in the next room. A vacuum cleaner produces "white noise," and it masks the bingo caller's voice. One must choose: clean carpet, or bingo.

#### Hearing

If the caller enunciates, projects, and paces—and someone's kid isn't banging out chopsticks on the piano—then it is reasonable to assume everything will go smoothly.

By age 80, it's not uncommon to experience a hearing loss of 50% in the frequency range of the human voice. Roughly one-third of the bingo players have some level of dementia, a symptom being confusion and agitation when dealing with the cacophony of many people talking at once.

Do you wonder how this feels? Try balancing your checkbook while teaching a freshman band class. Add in a persistent five-year-old learning to tie their own shoes. Formally, this is cognitive overload. Informally this is *Can you all just be quiet for ten minutes? Oh my gawd I'm getting a headache!*

By the way, good table mates look out for each other. After I scan my bingo cards, I stealthily check my neighbor's cards and politely point out any numbers they missed. Done quietly, this is a gesture of kindness.

## Game Phase Three—BINGO

It eventually happens. Sometimes from another table. Sometimes from my table. Sometimes I double-take at my card and hear myself yell **BINGO**!

There are three winning patterns: Five in a row, five in a column, and five diagonally. Sometimes, we have three additional patterns: four corners, picture frame, and the high-stakes *blackout*. (more about blackout in a minute) Some callers try additional patterns (i.e. postage stamp, two lines, small diamond) but approval is mixed.

Upon hearing bingo, the caller pauses the game and verifies the winner.

An experienced caller will remind players *not* to clear their board until the bingo is confirmed. If a bingo isn’t confirmed, the confusion quotient of the room will rise. Any player who mistakenly cleared their board will request a re-call of all the drawn numbers, but that takes time and is not popular.

Confirming a bingo is mechanically easy. The winning player reads out loud the numbers comprising their bingo, the caller confirms those numbers were actually called, and if in agreement, the caller announces a winning bingo. To the winner goes the nickels and everyone resets their bingo cards.

Sometimes it isn't easy. As in all steps of bingo, problems appear during the implementation. The concept of "out loud" has various interpretations with multiple variables, including speed of delivery and volume of the player. But...maybe the caller's hearing isn't as good as it used to be. Maybe other players are chatting/gossiping/remarking at how close *they* were to winning. Maybe the caller's memory for numbers isn't 100%. It happens, but hopefully not often and hopefully not to you more than once. There are a limited number of hours available to us, so pay attention.

### Blackout Bingo

Each evening bingo session includes ten rounds with the standard row/column/diagonal pattern. As mentioned above, these games cost one nickel per card. There is an additional, final round which uses a blackout pattern—cover **all** windows on the card. The cost per card doubles to *ten cents per card*. The table ante doubles from forty cents to eighty cents. Our bingo room has space for seven tables, so winning blackout bingo is a big payout—-over FIVE DOLLARS!

Blackout bingo takes longer than standard row/column/diagonal patterns, but the suspense is *killer!* I feel my blood pressure rise as I watch the card approach 100% coverage. Several times someone else calling **BINGO** has crushed my fantasy of a big payout. *Dammit!*

## Game Phase Four—PAYOUT

I've won several times! A victory dance is tempting. I would beat my chest, throw my winning bingo card across the room and shout "**I DOMINATE! I AM THE BINGO JEDI MASTER! COWER IN FEAR, ALL WHO BEHOLD ME!**" I haven't done this. My knees are not up to dancing around. My older table mates would be ill-advised to beat their chests, considering any history of heart trouble. Finally, throwing anything across the room is likely to poke someone's eye out. Surely an official memo will be the result.

When I win, I revel in the momentary endorphin rush of seeing a pile of change pour into my bingo change jar. I tell my table friends how much fun that was and how surprised I am to win. Then I get ready for the next round.

### Two or More Winners

Normally, one person wins each round, but sometimes two (or more) people win at the same time. (The odds of winning bingo is a fascinating subject if you are a statistician or math professor. Look it up on the internet. The rest of us should leave the math geeks in peace).

When multiple **BINGO!**s are confirmed, winners split the prize. As a money collector, it is my job to perform this split. There are two strategies I use to accomplish this accounting feat of derring-do.

-   Use math.

-   Use eyeball.

There's a secret I learned, and I'll tell you if you promise not to make a big damn deal about it.

Here's the secret: Where I live, *nobody cares how much they won.*

I divide up the money in mostly equal piles. I pour that money into the winner's pouch or jar already containing an uncounted amount of change; there is no accounting trail or software involved. The thrill of the win counts. Delaying the start of the next game is a buzz kill.

## Cheating at bingo

We're all pretty sure James cheats. He wins *a lot*—at least, more than he should. I think I figured out how he does it. James sits with his back to a wall so no one can look over his shoulder. He uses small picture easels to hold his two bingo cards upright (Everyone else positions their cards flat on the table).

Here's the trick: In his mind, he combines these two cards into one, doubling his chances of a matching number. When he calls bingo and reads back his numbers, he may read the first number from the first card, then the second number from the *second* card, the third number from the first (or second) card, and so-on.

I have two considerations about this. First, James is showing advanced math skills by converting from a two-dimensional matrix to a three-dimensional array. That's impressive stuff and I'm loath to call him on his adept transformations.

Second, James may not realize he's cheating. Our brains are masters of rerouting around malfunctioning synapses. James may simply adapt to a brain injury sustained on a naval destroyer or army tank. I find it unappreciative to dismiss this level of error-correction as simple cheating.

Either way, I gain nothing by destroying the elated mood surrounding an evening of nickel bingo. I'm spending no more energy on policing James.

## Getting Older

Bingo isn't a metaphor for life or how to be an effective manager at work. It's just a game. But it's a game with friends. That's all that matters.

I find it curious we need games to help us socialize. But I try not to overthink it; I'm just here to get to know these people I'm living with. That's enough.
