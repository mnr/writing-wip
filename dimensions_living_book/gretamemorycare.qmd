## **5. The climax**

You've built your story up to the climax with rising action, and now the climactic scene (or scenes) will have the highest level of conflict, the greatest tension, and/or the most devastating emotional upheaval.

Several things vital to your climax include:

-   Your protagonist needs to be in the scene(s).

-   Your protagonist needs to resolve the conflict (no other character can do this).

-   The conflict and tension need to be highest at this point in the story.

-   You need to avoid deus ex machina (an unexpected power or event resolving the conflict, rather than your protagonist).

-   The central conflict of the story must be resolved.

The protagonist should face the biggest obstacle in the story and determine their own fate.
