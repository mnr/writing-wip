# Memory Care

As part of our rehabilitation efforts, Janell and I have been taking Greta on walks. She slouches over her walker.

"Walk like a super model," we tell her. "Tits Up!"

She laughs, straightens her back, and we resume our walk.

# Eloping

We have improved from her not making it to the bathroom to walking around the parking lot. Buoyed by our success, I have decided to enlarge our territory. Greta and I walk to the end of the parking lot and instead of turning left to circumscribe the lot, we turn right towards the garden center on the next block. It's an ambitious goal, but I'm confident she can sit on her walker and I could push her home. I suspect she would object to a fireman-carry, although it is something I need to practice to pass my first aid certification.

She struggles, but she makes it. We are rewarded with a stroll through the nursery and she mentions some of the vegetables she'd like to plant this next year.

This all seems like a great achievement until I am called into the ~~principal's~~ administration office the next day.

"Mark," The administrator of Dimensions Living says. "We saw you walking Greta around the block yesterday."

"I know," I say, filled with pride. "By next week we can be walking to the shopping mall!"

"There is a problem," she says. "You are getting Greta used to travelling off the property. She may wander off and forget how to get home. If she returns to Dimensions in the back seat of a police car, we have to either place her in memory care or she has to find a new place to live. And right now, we don't have any room in memory care."

This is called "eloping" and is different than the high-school ill-advised marriage activity. This is where a resident leaves the property, gets lost, and gets in trouble. There are fines and penalties for this type of happening. Families will sue the care facility. That's bad.

# Late Nights

Greta has been wandering the halls of Dimensions Living. Normally not a problem -- I wander the halls as well. The difference between Greta and I is that Greta shouts "HELP. WHERE IS EVERYBODY?" The staff helps her get back to her room and safely back in bed.

Yesterday, the staff saw her heading out of the parking lot. They sent Joan to chase her down.

"Greta," says Joan. "Where are you going?"

"I'm heading to the cafeteria," she responds without stopping. "I'm late for lunch."

It's dinner time, and she is heading for the highway. Neither are good indicators. Actually, both are clear indicators; It's time for Greta to move to the memory care unit.
