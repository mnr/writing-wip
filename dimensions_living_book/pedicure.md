# Pedicure {.unnumbered}

I am sitting in a robotic massage chair, my feet are in a bucket of water; Greta is in a similar predicament in the massage chair next to me. The other women in the mani-pedi shop try not to point and laugh; they aren't trying very hard.

I don't care what they think. I'm having a moment with Greta.

Greta likes to look good. Her hair is coiffed and she's always been a spiffy dresser. Her fingernails and toenails are trimmed, polished, and painted. Greta is a classy woman.

In contrast, I have curated the look of someone who just stepped out of the woods. I trim my nails with a Swiss army knife, my pants are ripped in non-fashionable places, and I wear a shirt when I must.

Greta goes to the hair stylist at Evergreen Meadows, but they don't do toenails or fingernails. Community members get together on Tuesday afternoons and pull out a box of expired nail enamel, but nobody is trimming cuticles, exfoliating or de-callusing. It's mani-pedi lite. (That may not be the technical terms for this type of thing, but mani-pedi's are not my field of expertise.)

I create educational videos for LinkedIn Learning. I demonstrate assembling electronics to an overhead camera; similar to a baking show with an overhead mirror. Nobody wants to look at my dirty fingernails so my producer, Raye, insists I get a manicure. Sometimes I forget.

"Oh look, we have a delay in filming," Raye tells me. She's being polite. "You have just enough time to run over to the nail salon and spruce things up."

I head off to clean and trim my nails, push the cuticles around, make things pretty. No nail polish, please. I do what my producer says - it's good policy. I have received manicures and I have the sponges and buffing pads necessary for the ordeal.

Today, Greta's toenails and fingernails need attention. Janell is normally the designated caretaker on girlie things, but she takes a schadenfreude attitude, volunteers me, then watches as I squirm. I lock my self-inflicted notions of manhood in a box, make an appointment at "Josephine's Nail Salon" and load Greta and myself in the car.

The toughest part of a manicure + pedicure is knowing when to talk. When I get the oil changed in the car, I surrender the keys, exchange a joke with the manager, grab a bag of free popcorn, and camp out with my email. Manicures are a different event; I don't have any good jokes about fingers, there is no popcorn, and I can't check my email because my fingers are busy getting soaked, buffed, or trimmed. Pedicures are another thing; what do I say to someone who is shaving off my calluses, digging out schmutz from under my toenails, and massaging my insteps. Do we discuss soap operas? (I don't watch any). Modern Philosophy as espoused by Descartes? (I think not).

This time, I don't have that problem; Greta is always chatty and we fall into easy conversation. I occupy myself by figuring out the mystical icons on the control panel in the armrest, providing Greta with the benefit of my newly acquired mastery of the massage chair. I've had more relaxing massages from pneumatic jackhammers.

Earlier, Greta chose nail polish for both of us; a small bottle labeled "Valentine Fuchsia." From what I can tell, it is just Rust-Oleum Ford Red automotive engine enamel but in a smaller bottle. It would take a lot of these little bottles to cover an engine block.

After my feet and hands have been sanded and prepped, the painting begins. The manicurist skips a coat of primer before applying Valentine Fuchsia. She is quick and efficient and has five fingers completed when Greta interjects;

"Oh, ick," Greta says. She's looking at my painted fingernails. "That color is too red. I'm going to pick something different." She paws through the box of Rust-Oleum bottles and comes out with a more conservative pink.

I now have a problem which will compound itself in the coming days. I can stop and switch to match Greta's choice, but this means enduring the grinding necessary to remove the current color. I elect to continue with Valentine Fuchsia for my remaining fifteen nails. The manicurist irradiates my fingers with army-surplus plutonium and the polish becomes heat-resistant and immune to chipping. Those are qualities of good engine paint, so I assume that is true here as well.

Manicures and pedicures aren't unpleasant; unlike dental work, giving blood, or a vasectomy. Greta and I laugh at the absurdity of it all, then go to Culver's for a treat of frozen custard. The server at Culver's gives my fingers a glance, then takes our order. I can tell there is something slightly askew about our interaction, but don't spend time puzzling it out.

Three days later, we attend a funeral for a friend of Greta's from her early married days. Funerals are a convenient way to catch up on old friendships between those who are still standing. Or sitting. Or at least breathing. The after-funeral reception is happening at the local VFW, which means there is a cafeteria, a formal meeting room, a display case with war memorabilia, and a bar. I've never seen a VFW that didn't have all of these rooms.

I help Greta get comfortable at a table with her friends, make sure everyone has a cup of coffee, then fade into the background. The conversation is about people and events I have never known, so I wander off to the bar.

Bikers and other toughs fill this crowded bar; all former army grunts who believe an occasional bar fight is just good, clean fun. I have the sense to order a generic beer (no craft beers here), which costs me a buck and comes in an eight-ounce glass with an etched logo. I extend my hand to pick up the glass from the bar; the bartender looks at the glass, then my hand, then at me.

I forgot about the nail polish.

If these patrons beat me to a pulp for being a drag-queen-elitist-hack, I won't be able to drive Greta back home, so I need to reframe this situation before I run out of teeth. I play the favorite son-in-law card.

"My mother-in-law chose this color," I say. "She needed a companion and all her friends were busy. Otherwise she would have been lonely."

I'm thankful I'm wearing close-toed shoes. Birkenstocks would have not only confirmed my elitist politics, but also exposed my painted nails. This sort of thing is standard behavior in my hometown of Portland, Oregon, but that's 1,900 miles to the west. In Portland, if you are a man wearing fingernail polish, you are also probably wearing a wig and a sequined dress. You may be late for a city council meeting, which is a problem because you are *on* city council. Possibly *running* the meeting because you are the mayor.

But we're not in Kansas, or Portland, anymore. The bikers gathered around me say nothing. This could go wrong.

God smiles at his little joke, then sends Greta into the bar. She sidles up next to me; the bikers part and let her through.

"Hi Marky," she says. "Did you buy me a beer?"

"Gentlemen, this is Greta, my favorite-mother-in-law," I say. "Greta, please show them your nail polish. Please."

Greta looks at me as if *I'm* the one losing my mind, but produces her fingernails. Our colors aren't exactly the same, but similar enough to have come from the same hardware store.

Motherhood is a strong card to play and it works. The bikers aren't going to challenge Greta (nobody wants to get dressed down by an honored citizen half their height and a third of their weight.) I take a healthy chug of beer and burp; good-old-boy tactics.

I bought Greta that beer and stuck around while she drank it. I had no loss of blood and was able to drive her home. Maybe I'm being overly-dramatic (I am), but at the time, there were a lot of large men who were not wearing nail polish. There was one of me. Add Greta and there were two of us with paint.

## Tolerance

I grew up in St. Paul, Minnesota with an entitled attitude gained from living in a big city. I then went to school in Menomonie, Wisconsin, a small town of 12,000. It was only a few days before I offended one of my classmates by suggesting farmers were bumpkins.

"Don't make fun of farmers with your mouth full," he informed me. He was right. It was one of those unexpected lessons I learned at college.

Greta was forever willing to love those people around her, even when loving was a hard task. If I had things to do over again, I would try to follow her example and look for the good in everyone I encounter. Greta set a high bar on this one.

I require remedial sessions now and again. Portland tends to the liberal side of things, but I remind myself I live in a political bubble. If the VFW can see clear to my wearing Valentine Fuchsia, certainly I can seek to embrace their view of the world as well.

At Greta's funeral, I'll proudly wear fingernail polish in honor of the lesson she taught me. The next time I'm at the auto-parts store, I'll ask for a bottle of red paint and a small brush.
