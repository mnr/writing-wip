# Greta {.unnumbered}

I've only been married once, so Greta is my *only* mother-in-law. It amuses me to tell her of this fact. Greta always laughs and give me a hug. She calls me "Marky."

I first met Greta when I was twenty-four years old. Janell, who is now my favorite wife, introduced me to her family. I was too self-confident to be nervous about how they might feel about me. As long as I didn't smoke pot in the living room after dinner, I would get high marks. (I could make a funny comment about a "high Mark" - as in a *stoned* Mark - but I'll resist the temptation.)

Greta was born in 1934 and grew up in Marshfield, Wisconsin. She was one year old when the Social Security Act was passed. When she was sixteen a vaccine for polio was invented and tested. She went to college to become a teacher.

She grew up on a farm (as did everyone in Wisconsin in 1930). Her father maintained a small dairy herd and opened a roadside bar. She helped served roasted chicken and beer. Her dad served minors, although he was quick to tell these kids "you've had enough." He was also protective of Greta, reminding everyone to watch their language because there were women present.

Greta has told us (several times) about her experience in teacher's college. She was in charge of at least one of the annual trips and we have seen the pictures, diary entries, and budget. Greta was quite the sparkplug, singing and dancing until early in the morning, then getting her fellow students up and in the autos for another day driving through the mountains.

Greta married Gene after he came home from the Korean war and birthed five children in a small town in Wisconsin. She carried lunch down to his Citgo service station and did the banking for the business. She made dinner and thanked the Lord for such a good provider as Eugene Ross.

Her children, like all children, tested her limits. Her middle son memorized joke books and would repeat them, rapid-fire, at the dinner table. When dinner jokes became overwhelming, Gene sent the kids to the basement. I like to think Gene and Greta would sit at the quiet table, trying to keep an air of somber wisdom, but eventually smirking and then breaking out in snorts.

One daughter was famous for climbing down the antenna mast next to the house to sneak out for parties. One son collected beer cans. A *lot* of beer cans; empty ones. *Who emptied all those beer cans?*

## Meeting Greta

I stand about six-foot, two-inches tall and I'm the tallest of all the Niemann kids. My dad had the nickname of "shorty," which I originally thought was because of his height, but later learned it was due to his haircut. I am genetically like my grandfather, Louie, who stood 6-foot-6 and towered over Ella, his five-foot-and-a-little-bit-short wife.

Greta is about five-foot-nothing and barely comes up to my shoulder. When I first met Greta, she came out to the front door as I was unfolding myself from the front seat of our Volkswagen Rabbit. She gave me an unflinching hug in spite of the road odor I carried. To return her hug I had to bend over-almost getting down on my knees to equalize our height. She was so damned pleased to meet me.

Janell and I married, had kids, moved from the Midwest to Wyoming, then Colorado, then Portland, Oregon. Janell graduated as a Nurse-Midwife. I pursued software and computers. Gene died shortly after we moved into our Portland home. Greta kept showing up. We have a spare bedroom and she loves to clean house. I told her several times she should move to Portland. She laughed and turned us down each time.

I'm not sure why I have a close relationship with Greta. We didn't survive a plane crash in the Alps, foraging for food together in the frozen mountains. She didn't donate one of her kidneys to save me from a terminal illness. I've never borrowed money from her. Perhaps once for ice cream. But still, when I see her, my heart sings.

I'm sad our time together is drawing to a close.
