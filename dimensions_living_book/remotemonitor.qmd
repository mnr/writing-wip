# Greta By Wire

Greta has become a 24x7 project. I live one floor and one hall away. I can be at her door in two minutes--and I often am. I receive reports on her attendance at activities throughout the week. I watch her interact with her peers at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I *spy* on Greta. I am a helicopter son-in-law.

I am also a technology enthusiast. I teach how to program single-board computers with the python programming language. I post videos on how to build a weather station or implement telemetry transport between two microprocessors. I have an in-depth knowledge of the technologies necessary to place a camera in Greta's room and record her every motion.

I could also build a two-way wrist-radio for Greta. We could talk like Dick Tracy. I would know exactly where she was, updated every 500 milliseconds.

Two things prevent me from becoming an evil voyeur: Respect for Greta, and, well--Greta.

## Promise

I don't need to implement my own personal survellience device. An internet search will produce several pre-built devices designed to for elders and children to stay in touch. The promotional websites and videos show happy senior citizens dancing and interacting with their grandchildren. Everyone has perfect make-up and interesting dialog.

Greta's children have purchased an internet-connected picture frame. We can send photos of our lives to her device and they are displayed in a continuous loop near her favorite chair. She doesn't need to do anything to watch the pictures change, showing the best of her children out camping, her grandchildren swimming, or someone's new house. It's the electronic equivalent of the shelves of photo albums in her room.

## Reality

I made my fortune in high-technology and approach new technology with enthusiasm and optimism. I've worked on projects that have changed society and industry. I'm finally out of the inner circles of innovation, but I look with admiration at the emergence of new technologies and the thrill of the youngsters introducing this new round of world-changers.

However, this is where I devolve into being an old codger and royalty-collecting skeptic. Simply--the creators of these devices have clueless assumptions about how to bring Greta closer to her family. Let me provide a few case studies.

## Greta's Memory Versus Greta's Pictures

Greta and I have spent a lot of time reading books. She absolutely loves to be read to. One of her favorites is a book of poetry written by one of her grand-daughters, Claire Amara. Greta and I will sit on a couch, side-by-side. She has macular degeneration so her eyesight isn't good; I read and she absorbs. Claire writes about love and anguish, Greta listens to a poem, then remarks how wonderful it is.

"How does she know this?" Greta remarks. "That is so very thoughtful."

"I don't know," I respond. I've tried to get Claire to read her poems to Greta, but Claire won't do it. I understand---poems are supposed to be emotionally charged. But I wish I had better insight so I could share this moment of lucidity with Greta.

Tomorrow, I will read the same book of poems to Greta, and she will say much the same things with the same sense of wonder. I'm saddened because Greta doesn't have the brain chemistry necessary to carry these poems with her, but envious of her constant sense of amazement and appreciation. She never takes Claire's poetry for granted.

When we are done with Claire's book, I pick up the internet-connected picture frame. We have spent hours paging through these electronic images. Like Claire's poetry, I interpret each image for Greta.

"This is your great-granddaughter. She is playing in the water with her mother. This was about a month ago when we were at the family reunion at Green Lake. You were there."

"Oh," Greta responds. "I don't remember that. I was there? Who is this little girl?"

"That is your great-granddaughter," I respond. "We were at the family reunion at Green Lake." I pause for a minute, then swipe left to the next image.

"This is your grandson at his new business," I'm actually not sure what we are looking at, but her grandson is in the picture. I'm improvising.

"Oh. Now, which grandson is this?" Greta is working hard to keep her family tree intact, but the branches shift in the wind. It probably doesn't help when I insist she is my favorite mother-in-law. That's just confusing her.

"It's your second daughter's first son," I prod her memory. "He's a successful entrepreneur." I am her guide through these memories. If I invoke the right triggers, she will remember. But this time, her brain stubbornly refuses to make the connection. I move on to the next image.

When Greta tires, or is called for a meal, she will forget these images until the next time we sit on the couch and I narrate who these smiling people are. She won't pick this device up on her own - the pictures are meaningless without someone providing context and insight. By itself, this wondrous picture frame is no more significant than the clock on the wall.

## Telepresence with Greta

Forgive me as I stray into my first love of science fiction. Wouldn't it be wonderful If I could be in Greta's room this afternoon without the burden of traveling for five days? If I could accelerate the tachyon particles around me and warp myself across 1,000 miles of space-time continuum to appear in Stevens Point, Wisconsin.

"Hello Greta," I would say, shaking the tachyon residue from my shoes.

"Oh, hello Mark," She would respond without surprise. Time/space travel means nothing to someone who experiences discontinuity of time and space. All Greta cares about is that I am here.

This is the assumption of these senior-friendly video communicators. *POP* I am here! Let's talk!

Not true. Unlike my fictional time/space travel, this requires a series of steps.

1.  Turn the device on.

2.  Start the communication app

3.  Look at the camera and talk

4.  Disconnect the conversation when done

5.  Put the device away

Let me break this down.

### Turn the device on/start the app/look at the camera

This assumes several things. First, there is an agreement about *when* to turn the device on. Or the device makes some sort of an audible signal. Or Greta is actually in the room or awake when this is happening. The next assumption is someone is available to "turn the device on." Is the app visible? Is there a button that is clearly labeled "talk to *someone*." Is there someone in the room (an aide?) who understands what the device is doing and how to respond so that Greta can see the screen.

Then there is looking at the screen. Actually the camera. Greta (and most people I know) don't instinctively look at the camera. They look at the image of the person calling them. So we see up Greta's nose or the top of her forehead or who knows? But it's not really talking to Greta.
