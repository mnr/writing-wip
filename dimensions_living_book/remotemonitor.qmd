# Greta By Wire

I *spy* on Greta.

I receive reports from the staff on her attendance at activities throughout the week. I watch her interact with her peers at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I am a helicopter son-in-law.

Spying on Greta is easy since I'm with her most of the day, reading. She has macular degeneration so her eyesight isn't good. She loves to be read to, so we spend a lot of time side-by-side on the couch, me reading, her listening. One of her favorites is a book of poetry written by one of her grand-daughters, Claire Amara. Claire writes about love and anguish, Greta listens to a poem, then remarks how wonderful it is.

"How does she know this?" Greta remarks. "That is so very thoughtful."

"I don't know," I respond. I've tried to get Claire to read her poems to Greta, but Claire won't do it. I understand---these poems are emotionally charged. But I wish I had better insight so I could share this moment of lucidity with Greta.

Tomorrow, I will read the same book of poems to Greta, and she will say much the same things with the same sense of wonder. I'm saddened because Greta doesn't have the brain chemistry necessary to carry these poems with her, but envious of her constant sense of amazement and appreciation. She never takes Claire's poetry for granted.

If I wanted to, I could intensify my surveillance. My day gig is programming single-board computers with the python programming language. I post videos on how to build a weather station or implement telemetry transport between two microprocessors. I have an in-depth knowledge of the technologies necessary to place a camera in Greta's room and record her every motion.

I could also build a two-way wrist-radio for Greta. We could talk like Dick Tracy. I would know exactly where she was, updated every 500 milliseconds.

But this would be neither respectful, necessary, or realistic.

## The Promise

I don't need to build my own surveillance device. There are many pre-built devices for elders and their children to stay in touch. Some of them allow children to monitor their parents; a reverse nanny-cam. Promotional websites and videos show happy senior citizens happily interacting with their grandchildren over a flawless video link. Everyone has perfect make-up and interesting dialog.

In fact, Greta's children have purchased an internet-connected picture frame. We send photos of our lives over the internet. They fly to her picture frame where they are displayed in a continuous loop near her favorite chair. She doesn't need to do anything to watch the pictures change, and they show her children camping, her grandchildren swimming, or someone's new house. It's the electronic equivalent of the paper photo albums in her room.

## The Reality

I made my fortune in high-technology and approach new technology with enthusiasm and optimism. I've worked on projects that have changed society and industry. I look with admiration at the emergence of new technologies and the thrill of the youngsters introducing this new round of world-changers.

However, I've become a skeptic. Simply--the creators of these devices have clueless assumptions about what it takes to bring Greta closer to her family. Let me provide a few case studies.

## Greta's Memory Versus Greta's Pictures

When we are done reading Claire's book, I pick up the internet-connected picture frame. Like Claire's poetry, I interpret each image for Greta.

"This is your great-granddaughter. She is playing in the water with her mother. This was about a month ago when we were at the family reunion at Green Lake. You were there."

"Oh," Greta responds. "I don't remember that. I was there? Who is this little girl?"

"That is your great-granddaughter," I respond. "We were at the family reunion at Green Lake." I pause for a minute, then swipe left to the next image.

"This is your grandson at his new business," I'm actually not sure what we are looking at, but her grandson is in the picture. I'm improvising.

"Oh. Now, which grandson is this?" Greta is working hard to keep her family tree intact, but the branches shift in the wind.

"It's your second daughter's first son," I prod her memory. "He's a successful entrepreneur." I guide her through these memories. If I invoke the right triggers, she will remember. But this time, her brain stubbornly refuses to make the connection. I move on to the next image.

When Greta tires, or is called for a meal, she will forget these images until the next time we sit on the couch. I will narrate these images and the smiling people they contain. She won't pick this device up on her own - the pictures are meaningless without someone providing context and insight. By itself, this wondrous picture frame is no more significant than the clock on the wall.

*By the way, whoever designed this picture frame so that it didn't have a battery has never sat on a couch next to Greta. The power cord and wall outlet it must be plugged into is often more trouble than it is worth.*

## Telepresence with Greta

Forgive me as I stray into my first love of science fiction. Wouldn't it be wonderful If I could travel from Portland to Greta's room without the burden of traveling for five days?

"Hello Greta," I would say, shaking the time-travel residue from my shoes.

"Oh, hello Mark," She would respond without surprise. Time/space travel means nothing to someone who experiences discontinuity of time and space. All Greta cares about is that I am here.

This is the promise of these senior-friendly video communicators. Turn on the video connection and *POP.* I am here! Let's interact!

But these things fall short of the promise. Unlike my effortless time/space travel, they require a series of steps.

1.  Turn the device on.

2.  Start the communication app

3.  Look at the camera and talk

4.  Disconnect the conversation when done

5.  Put the device away

And even then, it's not me. There's no contact. I'm not sitting on the couch.

Let me break this down into smaller chunks.

### Turn the device on/start the app/look at the camera

These first steps assume several things. First, Greta and grandchild/child have an agreement about *when* to turn the device on. You would think she is available at all times every day, however:

-   If it is mealtime, Greta will be in the dining hall and not available.

-   If Greta has a medical appointment, she won't be in the building.

-   If she is at *Drumfit*, she won't be in her room.

-   If she is sleeping, nobody will wake her.

-   If she is having a bad day, her attendant may not have the patience to get her in front of the camera.

Let's assume the best set of circumstances; Greta is in the room, awake, and an aide is nearby. The device issues an audible alert which the aide understands is a request to start a conference between Greta and an interested party.

The aide picks up the device. Is the app visible? Is there a button that is clearly labeled "talk to *someone*." The aide helps Greta move to a place where she can see the device.

Great. Greta is sitting at the table in front of the device. Greta (and most people I know) don't instinctively look at the camera on the device. They look at the image of the person calling them. So on our side of the conversation, we see up Greta's nose or the top of her forehead or who knows?

### Disconnect the conversation when done

Let's assume the best of all outcomes and thus, Greta has a conversation with child or grandchild. The child overcomes their need to see Greta's face and accepts her forehead as a reasonable alternative. They find something to talk about. Hallelujah! The conversation is over and everyone says their goodbyes.

This is ignorant of Greta and her emerging chronological discontinuity. Remember; Greta perceives time in shorter loops than you or I. *Yesterday*, *this morning, today,* and *tomorrow* are no longer clearly defined. Those of us who are firmly rooted in linear time assume a conversation has a salutation, a body, and a close. Greta does not.

When I am in Greta's physical presence, I know a conversation will last until she needs a nap or dinner starts or the nurse arrives to check blood pressure or another interruption. It's not when I have completed a logical discussion of the topic for today. The queues to the stage of a conversation aren't available via video link.

### Put the device away

For the sake of a continued dissertation, let's assume the conversation has somehow ended. Our distant person logs off. Greta is left with a mute device (and probably an aide). Time to put the device away.

An aide will assume the device is fine where it is. Greta will assume the device has ceased to have importance and will leave it where it is. Or she will put it in a safe place.

Janell and I have established a secret language flag. I will say something like "Janell, I put \[*a thing*\] in a safe place."

Janell understands the phrase "safe place" as "I can't remember where I put it." The thing is lost until I trip over it or discover it in the refrigerator or other logical storage area.

So when I say Greta will put the device in a safe place, I mean she will lose it.

It also implies the device is connected to power so it can recharge.

More likely, the device is left on a table or near an armchair. At first, it is on the top of the stack of papers, but it is soon covered with *Catholicism Today, Wisconsin Travel*, The local *Pennysaver,* and a birth/wedding announcement from a grandchild. Hopefully it does make an audio alert so an aide can locate it under the stack. It's just as likely someone from house cleaning or a child-in-charge will place the growing stack of paper in recycling without realizing the stack contains a mute device.

Some devices have a "find me" feature which allows a smart phone to return the physical location or to play a loud signal. All these assume the device is charged, which implies it was plugged in the last time it was used. Both are unlikely.

## The Upside

In spite of my complaints, telepresence machines enrich my visits with Greta. Like Claire Amara's book of poetry, they are conversation starters.

"Greta," I say, putting away Claire's book. "Let's call your grand-daughter."

Her grand-daughter lives in London. I grab the ipad and return to the couch. I dial London, and wonder of wonders, Greta is online with another continent.

I will point out this morning I found the iPad on the shelf under the statue of the Madonna. It was drained and I plugged it in for a charge. I also checked the time from Wisconsin to London to make sure the call is reasonable for both continents. I also know Apple Facetime is the communication app of choice (not hangouts or zoom or skype. Remember skype?)

The time I spent connecting Greta with her granddaughter was worth all of that.

## No Way Around It

These wondrous devices are like hand puppets; they have no more value than the person holding them. Without a performer and an audience, they are inert lumps of stuff.
