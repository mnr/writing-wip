I had a tough relationship with my mother, Ellen. I was a moody teenager well into my thirties and only lately have learned how to be less demanding. Communication is difficult for me. I avoid conflict whenever I can. I told a therapist I was avoiding the karmic load of disagreeing with anyone. Better to stew in silence than tell someone their actions are unacceptable. 

Ellen's mother came to America from Germany in late 1939 on a vacation. While she was here, World War II broke out. Her mother, my great-grandmother, told her to not come back home. She never saw her parents again. She married a wonderful man, my grandfather, a mail carrier who played trombone. His family assumed she was a German spy, never trusted her, and shunned her. She was understandably depressed and, when angry, would go silent for weeks at a time.

With a mother that wouldn't speak for weeks, young Ellen must have wondered what she had done. Ellen was desperate for approval and insecure. She thrived on commiseration with friends. And family. When she asked, "How are you?" she was not looking for a casual answer. She wanted to know EVERYTHING. But not the victories of the day. She wanted the defeats, the sadness, the misery. When I ran in a cross-country race, she wanted to know if I was sad that I finished third place. Was I sad about the math test? Was I sad about my dead pet? Was I sad about what she made for dinner?

Ellen never developed a sense of humor. She scanned every conversation for sadness and defeat. She missed punch lines, absurdities, sarcasm, satire, and puns. After I moved out and gained some distance, I would explain my humor to her. I would tell a joke, then explain the joke. She would think for a minute, realize she was supposed to smile, and smile. Then she would go back to searching for the sadness.

When I moved her out of her house, I came across two teddy-bears with voice boxes. When you squeezed their hand, they would recite an insipid sermon about how it was okay to be sad. It was a creepy reminder of my childhood. I threw them in the garbage.

For a pre-teen/teenager, the constant interrogation was exhausting. I barely knew what these emotions were and was totally unwilling to discuss them for hours. Literally. So I went silent.

My mom, Ellen, learned the craft of silent treatment from her mother and taught it to me. I used it on friends and family until I realized it wasn't a productive means of communicating my displeasure. I still do it. Sorry everyone.

Greta never goes silent. She is vibrant and vocal, and I love being around her. But this is a window of opportunity and I know it is closing.
