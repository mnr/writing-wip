## The purpose of a strong Climactic Sequence

The Climactic Sequence will spell an end to the conflict between your protagonist and antagonist, but contrary to popular belief, the Climactic Sequence isn\'t all about external action. It also solidifies the theme of your story. How so? 

Theme is intricately tied to the protagonist\'s core flaw or fear --- and their journey to overcome it. Though the Dark Night of the Soul is the moment that will solidify your protagonist\'s transformation, it\'s the Climactic Sequence that will showcase just how important that transformation is to protagonist\'s future.

Unsure of how to weave theme into your story\'s Climactic Sequence? Check out the excellent resources in the recommended reads below.
