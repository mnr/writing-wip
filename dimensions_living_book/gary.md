## The Fly

Everything would seem to be grand, but there is a disturbance in the force. Greta has designated her oldest son as the Power of Attorney (POA) of Finance.

We'll call him "Gary" although this might not be his real name. (It is). Gary decided he should also be Power of Attorney of Health Care and without conferring with his siblings, presented Greta with a document and a convincing argument. Greta isn't as sharp as she used to be and she signs.

You'll need to know a bit about Gary's politics. He is far-right, belongs to the Catholic church, but doesn't believe Pope Francis is the true pope. (Francis believes there is no hell, atheists can go to heaven, being gay might be okay. Francis thinks the church is obsessed with abortion, gay marriage, and contraception.) Gary believes abortion is an unforgivable sin and contraception is denial of God's will. Gary believes death with dignity or euthanasia is sinful. Gay marriage is a lifestyle choice and also sin. He believes in the sanctity of gun ownership. His world does not accommodate ambiguity, gray areas, or "it depends." Gary lives in a nightmarish world where demons conspire against men (who, in turn, make the decisions for women) and we are going to Hell. Literally. To the place.

You also need to know a bit about Greta's politics.

\[*strikeout text was moved to chapter: greta*\]

~~She grew up in central Wisconsin and loved her Dad. He ran a tavern and made it clear to his younger patrons that drinking was not an opportunity to harass his daughters. She's seen her girlfriends and sisters deal with date rape and unwanted pregnancies. She knows pregnancies don't always go well. She loves her gay nephew. She's seen men (and priests) misbehave and small town voices hush it up. Greta will tell you we are God's children and we are less than perfect, but we still deserve his love and if God loves us, then who are we to judge?~~

~~Greta lived through the polio epidemic. To her, vaccines are a miracle.~~ When COVID vaccines were offered (for *free*) at Evergreen Meadows Senior Community, she got in line with enthusiasm. Evergreen Meadows Senior Community was required to contact her POA of healthcare&mdash;Gary. Gary is convinced COVID is a made-up disease and the vaccine is another money grab by big pharma. When Evergreen Meadows Senior Community contacted Gary, he denied permission for the vaccine.

There isn't enough space available on this page to discuss the responsibilities and limits of a POA, but it's easy enough to know that a POA is responsible for *enacting the wishes* of the person they are responsible for.

In the case of a COVID vaccine, Greta goes back to her room, then shortly re-appears in line for a vaccine. Gary is again contacted and again, he denies the shot. This happens three times before the vaccine clinic ends and the opportunity to return to the line ends.

This is one vignette of the interaction between Gary and Greta. From the above narrative, you can assume there have been many more and they will continue to occur.

I have no power over this situation. Legally I don't have any standing and I'm not a sibling, so I maintain a respectful distance. Greta isn't in serious danger and her finances aren't large enough to be concerned about embezzlement.

But that doesn't fix the heartache I feel knowing she is being dragged through someone else's nightmare. I'm hoping you understand why I am willing to drive five days from Portland, Oregon to Stevens Point, Wisconsin just to make Greta laugh.
