# How I Got Here {.unnumbered}

For two months, I have been the youngest resident of my mother-in-law's senior community. I am a mere sixty-five-years old and am told I'm an interloper, an outsider to this community with no hope of truly joining for another fifteen years.

In contrast to my older friends at Dimensions Living, my knees still work, I do yoga balance poses without a chair, and I (occasionally) win at pickle ball. I eat and drink pretty much what I like and I stay up past 9:00 p.m. All of these disqualify me from living at Dimensions Assisted Living Facility.

Yet, here I am. How did that happen?

## **Housing**

The God I worship doth not smite nor crush nor strike down mine enemies. But oh, man--watch out for that omnipotent sense of humor. I'm certain God has a dashboard next to his almighty throne. The dashboard is covered with an infinite number of push-buttons. Each button has the name of one of his children.

When he deems it necessary, he speaks in a booming voice, saying "I have called you by name, you are mine." With a flourish big enough to encompass a universe, he pushes a button. One of the angels working in Heavenly IT support notes a display, flashing the words "Custard Cream Pie Successfully Delivered." Here on Earth, these metaphorical pies-in-the-face manifest themselves in many ways. For some, it is a slip on a banana peel. For others, being chased by a rooster through a cow pasture.

God turns to St. Peter with a smile and says, "Would thou likest to wager upon Mark? Five drachma sayeth he will accepteth any crazy idea I sendeth to his path."

With a sigh, St. Peter puts down his clipboard outlining the days agenda. It's difficult to keep an omnipresent deity focused on one task. "I accepth." He shrugs. It's the only way to get God back on track.

God pushes my button, a custard pie is delivered and manifests as a lack of housing in Stevens Point.

## My Custard Cream Pie

When we first arrive in Stevens Point, Janell and I try to stay in Greta's room. Dimensions Living frowns upon this co-habitation. For our part, we chafe at the closeness of three of us 24 by 7, side by side. I imagine it's as claustrophobic as riding in a 1971 Ford Country Squire from Wisconsin to Florida, but without seat belts.

I investigate long-term residency at the neighboring Holiday Inn: \$3,000 per month. No free breakfast, but access to the pool, weight room, and as many towels as you want. That's a lot of moola for sleeping next to the Clark County Fireman's Convention--or the FFA Regional Expo. Both events are loud and rowdy. Also not a solution.

I investigate AirBnB. There are no month-long stays available. I can string several one-week stays end-to-end, living the life of an urban nomad. We'll spend more time moving than making Greta laugh. This, too: not a solution.

We can purchase a house. We can then furnish the house. We can start service for electric, water, sewer, and garbage. Or we can hang out with Greta--but not both. Obviously not a solution.

We can rent an apartment--for a minimum of six months. Or not, because Stevens Point has no available six month leases. This is also not a solution.

## **The Solution**

Janell and I sit in the lobby discussing our predicament when Jenna, the Director of Marketing for Dimensions Living, joins us.

"I think I have something you'd be interested in hearing," Jenna says.

Janell and I perk up. Jenna is a source of local information with all the important contacts a Director of Marketing needs. She's friendly and we talk with her often. Maybe she's found a spare loft in the warehouse district. Maybe it has a floor and walls. Maybe it has vermin, but those I can deal with.

"We have a spare two-bedroom unit in the independent wing," she tells us. "It's not furnished, but comes with a meal plan. We can give it to you on a limited basis for the price of a single."

This means we would be within a two-minute walk of Greta's front door. And did I mention this is happening during a Wisconsin winter? Any way to avoid going outside is a bonus.

Janell and I realize this is our best (*only*) solution. We sign and are now residents of Dimensions Living.

In heaven, Saint Peter loses the bet (again). He curses and hands God a fiver. Betting with an all-knowing being is a losing proposition.

## Room 202

This room is quiet, but not lonely.

To the east are sunny windows shining a pattern of light on a red chair. Miles Davis shares his genius of vibrating the air I breathe. Outside and one floor below me is a sidewalk where Tom and Pauline are walking Zero, their Norwich Terrier. Foxes (the furry kind with tails) live in the vacant lot to the southwest of the apartments next door. I've made coffee; I can get kitchen coffee from downstairs but mine is way stronger than they are willing to brew.

Janell is downstairs with Greta. They are participating in *Drum Fit*, an exercise class requiring a chair, drum sticks, and a stability ball. Jenny--from a video screen--calls out rhythms and demonstrates suggested application of sticks to ball. She's a blonde Taiko drummer, infusing her energy into the room filled with senior citizens of limited mobility and stability.

I'll join them at 11:30 am for lunch in the cafeteria. Today is beef tips on rice, green beans, a salad, roll, tapioca pudding, and beverage of choice. The kitchen serves me a large quantity because I'm the most active resident of Dimensions Living. Most everybody else gets the medium to small quantity. The kitchen staff quickly learns who needs extra salad and pudding and who leaves green beans and rice on their plate.
