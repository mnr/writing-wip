# act 1 - inciting incident {.unnumbered}

Keep in mind that there can be several expositional scenes between a story's Hook and Inciting Incident. That said, it's the Inciting Incident that will first give readers a hint of the adventure to come.

It's also important to note that many protagonists won't immediately seize the opportunity presented in the story's Inciting Incident! The proposed journey would push the protagonist outside their comfort zone, and so they hesitate to act because of a core fear or flaw.
