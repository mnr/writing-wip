# Greta {.unnumbered}

Greta is my favorite mother-in-law. I've only been married once, and Greta is my *only* mother-in-law, so that's an easy declaration. But it amuses me to tell her of this fact. Greta always laughs and give me a hug. She calls me "Marky."

I first met Greta when I was twenty-four years old. Janell, who is now my favorite wife, introduced me to her family. I was way too self-confident to be nervous about how they might feel about me. I had heard stories about her previous boyfriends and I was sure I could easily live up to that standard. As long as I didn't smoke pot in the living room after dinner, I would get high marks. (I could make a funny comment about a "high Mark" - as in a *stoned* Mark - but I'll resist the temptation.)

Greta married Gene after he came home from the Korean war and birthed five children in a small town in Wisconsin. She carried lunch down to his Citgo service station and did the banking for the business. She was steady. Not flashy.

I stand about six-foot, two-inches tall and I'm the tallest of all the Niemann kids. My dad had the nickname of "shorty," which I originally thought was because of his height, but later learned it was due to his haircut. I am genetically like my grandfather, Louie, who stood 6-foot-6 and towered over Ella, his wife.

Greta is about five-foot-nothing and barely comes up to my shoulder. When I first met Greta, she came out to the front door as I was unfolding myself from the front seat of our Volkswagen Rabbit. She gave me an unflinching hug in spite of the road odor I carried. To return her hug I had to bend over-almost getting down on my knees to equalize our height. She was so damned pleased to meet me. I realized this thing with Janell would probably last.

Janell and I married, had kids, moved from the Midwest to Wyoming, then Colorado, then Portland, Oregon. Janell graduated as a Nurse-Midwife. I pursued software and computers. Gene died when we moved into our Portland home. Greta kept showing up. I told her several times she should just move to Portland. We have a spare bedroom and she loves to clean house. She laughed and turned us down several times.

I'm not sure why I have a close relationship with Greta. We didn't survive a plane crash in the Alps, foraging for food together in the frozen mountains. She didn't donate one of her kidneys to save me from a terminal illness. I've never borrowed money from her. Perhaps once for ice cream. But still, when I see her my heart sings.

I had a tough relationship with my mother. Maybe I'll seek counseling on that topic someday, but for now, I have the opportunity to experience Greta. But this is a window of opportunity and I know it is closing.
