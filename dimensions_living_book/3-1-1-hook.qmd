# act 1 - the hook {.unnumbered}

The Hook is the first scene or sequence in your novel, designed specifically to captivate readers. To be effective, a hook must do three things:

1.  Introduce the protagonist.

2.  Establish the protagonist's everyday life.

3.  Show the protagonist dealing with an everyday conflict.

These keys give readers a strong understanding of not only who your protagonist is, but what they're like --- their personality as well as the flaws, strengths, and fears that make them unique. 

Introducing an everyday conflict that showcases your protagonist's dissatisfaction with life can also *kickstart* your story's forward momentum. You're showing readers that your protagonist's life cannot go on as is. Something needs to break --- and it's going to break soon.
