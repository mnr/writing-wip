# Hallway Artwork {.unnumbered}

Walking to Greta's apartment, I noticed the artwork on the walls.

It's bland; something you see in hotel lobbies. Let us ponder the classic painting of the genre, titled "Hunting Grouse." It's a wash of fall colors, mostly orange fading to brown. There is, predictably, a grouse in flight and a hunter in the distant background. The bird is flying to the left, the hunter is walking to the right. The subjects of the painting are trying their hardest to escape this mundane print.

This art is designed to be less interesting the longer you look at it. These paintings are chosen so the colors of the art match the paint of the hallway, rather than choosing wall colors to accentuate the art. The corporate Optics and Design department strives for a calming theme that won't disrupt anyone's delicate sensibilities.

This pisses me off. Who the hell made the decision I need to be calmed? Some corporate focus group concluded if us members of this senior community are presented with visually challenging artwork we will require weeks of therapy. Worse, our children and heirs will initiate lawsuits to collect for mental anguish.

Corporate design teams forget I live with college professors. Poets. Musicians. Librarians. World War II veterans who RAN into combat with a single-shot carbine and a green cotton shirt. I live with men and women who crippled themselves on a potato field but now miss their farm. How dare they present a piece of art intended to calm. me. down. WTF?

I have discovered the current art is mounted with adhesive tape - not screws. With one quick yank, I could replace "Pheasant on the Prairie" with Dali's "The Persistence of Memory." I could dismount the western landscape and replace it with John Berkey's "Feather Ship."

Remember Dave Smith? He was the Scarabocchio guy and a former resident of Dimensions. Were he still alive, I would sneak to his door late at night (after 6:00 pm) and invite him to help me replace bad with good.

This artwork rebellion would require help. A resident at the far end of the building could push their pendant, summoning the late-night staff. It takes ten minutes to walk from the staff room to the far apartment, reset the pendant, then return. Dave and I would have five minutes to remove "Sunset Over The Desert" and hang "The Sly Shy Spotted Sagacious Snipper Snapper."

I estimate there are ten prints per hall. The memory wing doesn't have wall art, and the independent wing doesn't have staff (we assume we can do what we want with artwork in the independent wing, although that may not be true). That leaves three wings with about thirty prints Dave and I would have to clandestinely replace. This presents three problems: our artwork supply, willing accomplices, and movement of the artwork.

Thirty prints is a lot. This isn't stuff you find at Fleet Farm; you have to procure it. I'm guessing residents have favorite artwork stored with children and would agree to it hanging in our hallways. Janell and I have been entrusted with one such piece, "*Pumpkin and Table*." I'm sure Alberta, the former owner, would take delight in the wickedness of the entire project and approve the donation.

I'm certain we can enlist residents to distract the staff. The pendants are known to randomly trigger so the consequences of a button push are minimal. If we have a cadre of five button-pushers, we should be good to go.

Imagine our logistics-director-in-charge-of-art-replacement standing in front of the white board in the activity room. A floor plan of Dimensions living is sketched out in red dry-erase marker.

"Our target is Western Sunset with Cowboy hanging outside of the director's office," says our logistics director. She draws a green circle on the floor plan. "Bob, you'll move to the end of the independent wing, second floor, right near the elevator." A black circle indicates Bob's position.

"Gladice, you'll position strike team alpha in the first floor unisex bathroom. You will have the substitute Picasso '*The Three Musicians*'."

"I don't like the unisex bathroom," says Gladice. "It doesn't get cleaned often enough. Can we use the women's bathroom instead?"

"The women's bathroom is thirty feet away from the target," says our logistics director. "The unisex bathroom is right across the hall. Given that everyone in the strike team is using walkers, the distance is critical. Use the unisex bathroom, you'll need the extra time."

"Zeta Team," she continues. "You will be in the auditorium for the late-night movie. At precisely 8:00 p.m., Bob will trigger his pendant and you discretely leave the movie and move towards Alpha team." The Logistics director draws a black box with arrows pointing in the direction of movement. "Don't mess this up again. The movie is supposed to be Titanic. If you don't want to miss the conclusion, watch it beforehand."

"Zeta team will pass the staff heading towards Bob. When Zeta team reaches the target, they will remove Western Sunset with Cowboy and proceed to room 423 - which is the designated drop zone. Leave the print under the bed. Return to your rooms via different routes."

"When you pass the unisex bathroom, knock three times," Logistics demonstrates this knock on the table top. "Alpha team, that is your signal to hang your substitute."

"Remember, you can't be quick, so be efficient," she caps her dry-erase marker. "Any questions?"

There is the issue of moving thirty new prints into the building and moving the replaced artwork out. Administration or staff are going to take note of the arrivals, even if spaced out over time. Taking the old prints to the dumpster is sure to be noticed, especially since transporting a large print on a walker would be a dead giveaway of the nefarious plot.

I won't disclose how this would be accomplished. But if I were trying to curtail this project, I would be suspicious of sons or daughters with a pick-up truck and a tarp. Maybe that Sunday afternoon visit isn't just taking grandpa out for lunch...

## The Beauty We Miss

For art to be appreciated, you must spend time with it. Flipping through a coffee-table book about the Louvre will not reveal the wonder of the Mona Lisa. You must spend time looking at her eyes. You must see the delicate veil over her hair. Who else was in the studio? Why is she smiling?

To appreciate the community I live with takes time. You can't wander through on a Sunday afternoon and hope to notice subtle details. You will walk by the artwork of the grouse and hunter but never see it. You'll never look up and notice the umbrella at the corner of California and Florida. If your parent bothers to explain this umbrella, you might dismiss the whole story as another symptom of an aging mind.

You can't just march in and expect the world to reveal itself at your demand. Instead, you must be patient and allow the hallway to unfold as it is ready. There are comfortable chairs--you should try one.

Later, when you depart, would you do me a favor? If you see any artwork around the rear of the building, please discretely place it in the back of your pickup. You may keep it or dispose of it as you see fit. Strike Team Zeta appreciates your assistance.
