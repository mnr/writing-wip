# act 1 - first plot point {.unnumbered}

This is the moment of no return. Typically arriving between the 15% - 25% mark of a story, the First Plot Point not only represents the first turning point in your story, but also the moment the protagonist chooses to engage with the action of the story.

## Breaking down the First Plot Point

Between the Inciting Incident and the First Plot Point, you may find that you need to write one or more scenes to continue to expand upon your protagonist's world and inner conflict. After all, our readers must first *care* about our protagonist if they're to want to join in on the journey. 

In some cases, however, the Inciting Incident and the First Plot Point may actually be the same event. This typically occurs when a character is thrust into engaging with the story, whether by force or extreme stakes, rather than hesitating and later *choosing* to do so. (See: the example of *Hunger Games* below.)

No longer can they afford the consequences of inaction: they must engage with the events that have been set in motion or risk far greater consequences.

Ready to see how the First Plot Point plays out? Let's return to the examples we've used before.

In *The Hunger Games*, Katniss volunteers to take her sister's place in the Games --- thus pulling her into the heart of the story.

In *Pride and Prejudice*, Darcy encourages Bingley to break off his relationship with Elizabeth's sister Jane. This cements Elizabeth's hatred for Darcy, despite the man's growing affection.

In *The Fault in Our Stars*, Augustus shocks Hazel by revealing he has arranged a meeting with her favorite author, whose book has an ambiguous ending that's haunted Hazel for years.

## The end of Act One

With the First Plot Point effectively functioning as a point of no return, the protagonist has finally begun to engage with the story set in motion. And so Act One of the 3-Act Story Structure comes to a close.
