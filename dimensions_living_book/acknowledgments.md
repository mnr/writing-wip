# Acknowledgments {.unnumbered}

The Ross family has always been gracious and welcoming, traits they learned from Greta. I am grateful for their memories and permission to document my experiences. Thanks, Bob, Kathleen, and Connie.

I am part of the exclusive club of Ross in-laws. We joke and snark about the siblings, but we love them dearly. Thanks Lisa and Mike. We're going to write a handbook on surviving with the Ross family. And Mike; let me know when it is your turn to be the favorite son-in-law. I'll be happy to ship you the T-shirt, ballcap, and lapel pin.

The barn and repository for stolen property was courtesy of Jon and Sharon (and Iris, Ike, and Ruby). Thanks for not kicking me out of the dorm room, even when I deserved it.

I am grateful to the assisted living facility where much of this happened. They requested I respect the anonymity of staff and residents, but you know who you are and hopefully, you know the universe of respect I have for you and your profession. Thank you for being Greta's best friends.

Ask any writer about the task of getting useful reviews and edits. Their response will start with an exasperated sigh, then you will hear of the difficulty of finding someone who will provide a useful review. I am indebted to Don Barnes, Robin Rolfe, Abbie Weisenbloom., John Goff, Janet Patin, Dick Morgan, Mari Partenheimer, Greg Moore, Paul Bigler, Amy Houchen, and Linda MacIntyre.

Finally, Janell. Thank you for welcoming me into your life and for the opportunity to meet one of the finest people I have ever known. I'm sorry I shrunk your laundry.
