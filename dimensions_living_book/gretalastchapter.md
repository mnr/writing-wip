# Coda {.unnumbered}

I wake up at two o'clock in the morning. The streetlight outside our Portland house flickers through the leaves on our tree. If I open my eyes, I'll admit I'm awake and can't go back to sleep. Janell is ~~gently~~ snoring next to me, which she'll do for another half-hour before she returns to deep sleep. I leave her to her dreams.

I know it's two in the morning because I heard my father's clock chiming the hour. It's a Seth-Thomas Ogee, built between 1842 and 1913. It has two weights; one for the clock and one for the chime, and it rings out each hour. No fancy Westminster chimes; just once for one-o'clock, two for two-o'clock. The clockworks are in plain sight when I open the glass front to wind it up.

I also received a clock from my mother. It is much more ornate and the chime is louder and more melodious. It's clockworks are hidden inside the case and when it rings the hour, it is much more demanding of attention and keeps everyone awake. We don't wind the alarm anymore but I can hear it tick-tock all the way downstairs. My mother waited up late at night for me to come home from a night of youthful disobedience, her clock has the same late-night presence.

I fiddle with email for a moment, then go downstairs for a snack. I keep a jar of pickled Spicy Brussels sprouts for this sort of thing. Janell hates them, so I enjoy the treat without feeling the need to save some for her.

I pour a glass of water and head back to the stairs, passing the living room. I hear someone humming. I glance over, and see Greta sitting in the red chair. Both her and the chair seem to be content.

My rational self knows Greta is 1,945 miles to the east, sleeping in her bed at Evergreen Meadows Senior Community. She isn't here, just as the red chair doesn't manifest ghosts.

"Hello Marky," she says. "What are you doing up so late?"

I sit on the couch and place my water on the side table. "Couldn't sleep," I say. "What are you doing here?"

"There's lots of places I can be. I don't have to choose. So I'm here."

"But you're in Stevens Point."

"Some of me is. Some of me isn't. The parts of me you don't see in Stevens Point don't cease to exist, they just fade from one place and show up somewhere else."

I try to remember our conversations in her home where I first met her. She loved to play cribbage, so like a good host, I get a deck of cards and a cribbage board.

"Cribbage?" I ask. I pull up a small table, put out the board and deal the cards.

"I thought you didn't play cribbage?" she asks.

"You taught me. I play on special occasions."

"I'd love to," Greta responds. "But you're going to have to help me with cards. My hands don't hold things very well. I guess that's one of the things still in Stevens Point."

I'm not very good at cribbage, but Greta is patient. She used to always win, but when I've played with her in Stevens Point, she has a hard time remembering how the game is scored.

I spread the cards out and Greta points at one of them. I turn it over; a four of hearts. I draw an ace of diamonds, so I get the first crib. I deal six cards to each of us and put two cards in my crib. Greta points at two cards and I place them in the crib as well. Greta points at a card in her hand on the table; I turn it over. It's a nine of clubs.

I play a two of spades. She plays a three of hearts. I play an ace. For that, I get 2 points for fifteen, three points for a run. I'm feeling cocky until Greta plays a second ace for two points. We play out the cards, count out the pairs, I count crib. She plays confidently, I sputter along, trying not to make a mistake. The round ends with Greta at 10 points, I'm at fourteen.

"What's it like?" I ask. I deal for Greta, cut the deck.

"What's what like?" She points to cards and tells me to add them to her crib.

"Death. Heaven. The afterlife?" I play the four of hearts.

"I don't know," says Greta. "Ask me after I'm dead. But even then I won't be able to tell you much." She plays the four of diamonds for two points.

"Because you signed an NDA?" I play the four of spades for six points.

"No," Greta laughs. "Because these spoken words don't have what it takes to describe it. Explaining it is kind of like talking to chickens, right? We'll be happier if we don't try to puzzle it out."

The round ends with Greta at twenty-eight, I have twenty-three. I pause, take a drink of water. What do you ask a ghost, or whatever it is I am talking to? How to get rich? How to be all-powerful? Where did I misplace my keys?

"Will you see Gene?"

"I hope so. He's my soul mate. *Always* has been, *always* will be. I'm looking forward to it."

I deal, we put cards in the crib. Greta plays the eight of clubs. I play a seven for two points. Greta plays another seven for an additional two points. Greta 30, Mark 25.

"Is Janell coming down?" she asks.

"I doubt it. I'll tell her you were here."

"Don't bother. I'll tell her myself." Greta is fading from view. "Tell her she made a good choice when she married you."

"I miss my parents," I tell her. "I'll miss you too."

Greta says nothing. I look up and she is gone. Just an empty red chair, a cribbage board, and a glass of water. The house is quiet except for the clock.

Due to genetics and monitoring my blood pressure, I'll live to be a hundred; not an exaggeration. When Greta isn't able to laugh at my jokes, I'll need to find someone else to carry on that task. I guess that's one reason (among many) to delight in grandchildren.

I'm a better person because of the time I have spent with Greta. I look forward to spending more time with her peers -- who will quickly become my peers. I've decided to embrace my age with enthusiasm and try to live up to the lessons I've learned from my favorite mother-in-law.

---MORE------

\[Greta Ross\] Me alone very much. So that I, I could learn something. So, That's, that's how it was. So I I learned the kind of, on my own. But with my dad, Uh, guidance in the background. Yeah.

\[Greta Ross\] And went to Catholic school. And, I really loved what I did. You know, we put on plays. At the parochial school? Yeah,

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Yeah. So we had

\[Greta Ross\] To learn how to memorize and then how to act and um,

\[Greta Ross\] I learned out and then is a very Do

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] You want this on or off?

\[Greta Ross\] What does at least? Um, this is a better, all right?

\[Greta Ross\] What what orders do? I want? A regular person that is very knowledgeable in many things. She's not just this religious biased thing. But she just knows how Um,

\[Greta Ross\] To present herself as she asked to what she is. You know, it's funny.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Every time I hear about nuns in school, I hear about um, rulers You know how they always get their knuckles. Wrapped with a ruler. Did you ever get your knuckles wrapped? No. You were. You were one of the good kids? You've never had a nun disciplined.

\[Greta Ross\] Oh, yeah, yeah. But I, I guess. I just respected them as my teacher, as I would, so I didn't think anything of it.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] That they were that they were. Whapping you with a ruler. Yeah. But they never they never hit you with a ruler. No, because you behave yourself.

\[Greta Ross\] Because because you

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Behaved yourself. Oh

\[Greta Ross\] Yeah. Yeah, right. Yeah.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Dude, you know, Janelle. All your kids grew up in the Catholic church over in Neillsville and then when Janelle and I got married, she became a presbyterian. Do you remember that?

\[Greta Ross\] No, I don't but a presbyterian is the closest to the Catholic. It's well

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] It's a branch of the Protestant church. Yeah. Yeah.

\[Greta Ross\] But it's still. Yeah, a branch of

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] It's, you know, it's not like we are Muslim or, you know, we didn't go over and be Buddhists but, you know, we're Presbyterian. I just wondered if you ever had a a reaction to that or if you you know, wish that I had become Catholic. Or Um

\[Greta Ross\] Well I was Catholic. Yeah,

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Yeah.

\[Greta Ross\] Went to Catholic school and learned a lot of things about

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] I I remember you saying that that Gene had an opinion about how to treat women and it did not involve running around. I never heard that. Where, that had actually come from. Sounds like he learned it from his dad in it, not the way you'd expect, but yeah.

\[Greta Ross\] Yeah. You know, and A man is a man. A woman is a woman. Yeah, yeah.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] And,

\[Greta Ross\] Youtube, most women don't want to get involved with the sexual part because they're the ones who are left with carrying a child. Oh

\[Greta Ross\] Oh

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Yeah. So that'll be. That'll be fun to do. We'll go out in the water and Turn upside down and see what happens.

\[Greta Ross\] So you want to learn. You want to know how to swim?

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Yeah, well, you got him. You gotta be okay with the water. Yeah, yeah. And swimming is Handy. But there's other things you need to learn too. Yeah, you'll need to learn how to go upside down and not panic,

\[Greta Ross\] And be

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Able to, you know, do something about it without. But you

\[Greta Ross\] Learn how, how to breathe differently?

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Uh, you learn to hold your breath,

\[Greta Ross\] Okay?

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Breathing underwater is you no matter matter. Water. You just don't ever get it. That's not that's not something we do. So Um, Yeah, that's that doesn't work for us so but

\[Greta Ross\] It's a great thing to do all the time.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Breathing underwater.

\[Greta Ross\] No, no. Like you guys going out and swimming? And

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Yeah, yeah. Well, we um, we yeah. So our our job is to teach NOAA and Miles how to paddle a kayak. So that's one of the things that we need to get started on is to get them. We're working on swimming right now. First, they need to get used to the water.

\[Greta Ross\] Okay. Uh, who was the first two

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Miles and Noah Those were my grandchildren. So are my children are Aaron and will And then will has two children, Noah and Miles. And Janelle and I are in charge of teaching, Noah and miles how to swim.

\[Greta Ross\] Are you mastering it?

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Am I mastering? How to swim? I know how to swim. You know,

\[Greta Ross\] I know the one that you Which child,

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] So teaching the kids to swim, you know, you just, you take your time, you go to the pool and um, Every time they go to the pool, they get a little bit more used to being around in the water. You know, neither one of them. Because neither one of them are jumping off the side of the pool yet. Um, but they'll get it. They'll be they're they're, you know, they're clever young men and they will learn how to swim and they will see their grandparents like to go swimming and their parents go swimming. They'll eventually go like okay, well this must not be a scary thing. This is something that people just do.

\[Greta Ross\] So

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] We'll do that. Yep. So Yeah. I

\[Greta Ross\] Know, um, I heard this comment, we'll just stand by the edge of the water.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Just stand there and do what nothing,

\[Greta Ross\] You know, somebody will come along and push you oh

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Well, yeah I oh boy. You know I used to go to Camp Saint Croix and they would have swim lessons and I was always scared. Of going on swim lessons because I didn't want to jump in the water. It's like I don't want to do that. Um, so it was always kind of a panic to You know, and I just I had to get used to it. I get used to jumping in the water. So, Okay. Fine. Jump in the water. Here we go. Um, so I learned, you know, I learned enough to be able to paddle a kayak and I can roll a kayak now and

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Bill, but, that took some time whenever you guys are done visiting. If you want to play cards with us, we're going to play cards. Okay? Why don't you go ahead and get started? Yeah, appreciate it. Thanks. It's okay. Okay good. Yep, appreciate it. So yep. Hey Carl Can we, uh, Is there any chance I can get like something to drink out here? Keep her liquid. Okay. Got to knock on everybody's doors. You take no rush. Thank you. Yeah, yeah.

\[Greta Ross\] Like who's back? Yard is this?

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Uh, this is where you live. This is the garden.

\[Greta Ross\] Okay. Because I recognize that Building.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Yep. Is that where the school is? Is that where the school is? What do you recognize that building as

\[Greta Ross\] Um, the peak? Okay? Yep. I don't know. Okay. But you

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Recognize the building? Yeah, yeah. Uh, and there's a big white fence. This big white fence here. Yeah.

\[Greta Ross\] Yeah,

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] I know at one point you were telling us that You worked at a school that was like this where there was a school over there and the kids would throw the balls over the fence. And then you had to go get the ball. Didn't you you taught at that school? Didn't you?

\[Greta Ross\] Well, as you talk about it, I don't know, I know what you're talking about. Yeah but I don't know what. Chances are I did teach there. Yeah. Because that would be the only reason I'd be there.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Yep, yep. Well I remember you talking about that but I know this this building over here has been there. Um ever since we've been here. Ever, since you moved in, Not surprising that. You would recognize that. You know, yeah.

\[Greta Ross\] But I do recognize that building, not from the back, but but

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] From the front, yeah, that big Peak on it. Yeah. Um, And I am trying to think of which direction we're looking here, but we're looking over the fence and Um, there's Gray brick. Well, beige what color is that beige? Maybe Kind of a yellowy sort of a beige color with a green trim and a peaked false front. Well, they call that a false front building So it looks more impressive than it really is. Yeah. I heard a story recently. You know how sometimes grocery stores? They have these big, they're big just boxes, right? But they build signs up on top.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] In some grocery store, built a large. Peaked. Room up on top of the On the building. And they didn't use it at all, but then they realized somebody had moved in To this big open, basically an attic, and we're living up there and living up there for months. And they had a coffee machine, and they had a mattress and some place to hang their clothes and They had found themselves a nice comfortable spot to move into that, they weren't paying rent on, didn't have to pay rent

\[Greta Ross\] And it was wonderful.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] They thought it was pretty okay, you know, and apparently someone Saw an extension cord going into this.

\[Greta Ross\] Into this building.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] And wondered. Why is there an extension cord going into an unoccupied space? And they went in there and found all this, all the stuff that somebody had moved in and it was living there full time. So, Very, very clever very resourceful on that behalf.

\[Greta Ross\] Well, if you can get by with it, Well I don't

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Think the grocery store was okay with it. They kind of asked him to leave and take your coffee maker with you.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] There's Janelle. We were just talking about this Peak building over here. Oh

\[Greta Ross\] Yeah.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] A story that I had heard about somebody who. Um, Moved into. Uh, one of the they had built a structural except on top Safeway or some sort of thing and he built a, you know, a big peaked area in there and somebody had found out that was open, it was Hollow and they had moved in. You know, they were living there and they had a coffee machine. One cranberry juice, do you want me to go in and get something else? No, that's great. The fight over. Who gets what

\[Greta Ross\] I we will I thank you girl.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Yeah, what would you like? Greta orange juice or cranberry juice or both?

\[Greta Ross\] It didn't make me any difference. Well then have

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Some cranberry juice. There you go. It's thought it'd be good to have a little something to drink out here.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Well, I'm thinking of it, I'm

\[Janell Niemann-Ross\] Going to order some things for your um hearing aids for,

\[Greta Ross\] What

\[Janell Niemann-Ross\] For your hearing aids, um, that you need, um, some little wax cleaner, you know, these little filters that clean out the wax out of the hearing aids.

\[Greta Ross\] Oh, the hearing aid? Yeah. Okay. That's what I put in my ear, though.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] The the little hearing aid things. That's, that's what you're supposed to do with hearing aids.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] That is. Mmm, that is recording. I just thought it'd be fun to have a recording of what we're talking about. Let's just listening.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] What

\[Greta Ross\] Are these eggs? Well, these are

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Little green stones. It looks like somebody painted them. I don't think they're eggs, right?

\[Greta Ross\] No, it feels like a stone. Yeah, it's a

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Stone. But did you know that Janelle and I are going to get chickens again.

\[Greta Ross\] Well, you've had chickens often. Yes.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] And we recently got rid of them because we weren't around enough. And now, We're going to be around a lot more. And so we decided Well, we like chickens. But we're looking for ways to To reduce the costs of having chickens. But I, um, I mentioned that we're having chickens to our neighbor girls. And they were very excited. They I said, we're getting chickens again and they were like oh this is great. They love the chickens.

\[Greta Ross\] And chances are. The shit, the chickens learn to love them. Um,

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] In their own little chicken way. Yeah. Well you know I mean chickens there's not a lot of brain power going on there but they recognize different things. I have a corn or a can A metal can and I put corn in it. And I train the chickens that when they hear this can shaking That there's a treat to be had. And so I can you know they'll be wandering all over the place and I'll shake that can and they just come running like flapping their wings and they want to be first in line to get the corn that they know is going to get spread out for them. So that's some so they got that. They figured that out pretty quick

\[Greta Ross\] But you might

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] They figure that out they figure out the corn and the can thing pretty quick. Can I still have that can Great. They They learned they learn really quick, so you know. So we will train them. To learn about that.

\[Greta Ross\] Can you teach Them to eat. Oh, this thing's from the leftover meal.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Oh, so we have a very interesting plan. Do you know what? Um, well, you know what flies are Flies. You know, they fly around. Yeah, yeah,

\[Greta Ross\] Okay. So

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] There's a special kind of fly called a soldier fly There's a special kind of fly called a soldier fly. That's what it's called. It's a little, it's a fly, okay?

\[Greta Ross\] And it

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Lays eggs, and the eggs hatch out, little maggots little larva, right? And if they um, If you put garbage in a bucket, The compost, right? Old lettuce, trimmings and old vegetable trimmings, and then you um, put that in a bucket and you put it outside Soldier. Flies will come lay eggs in that.

\[Greta Ross\] Soldier,

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Soldier flies. Yeah, like soldiers. Like marching,

\[Greta Ross\] Okay,

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Soldier flies and then The eggs hatch into maggots. And then, when the maggots are ready to turn into pupae They will climb. They want to climb up and get on top of a branch somewhere. So they're they're naturally inclined to climb upwards. So you give them a little ramp to climb up and at the end of the ramp is a hole. And so they climb up the ramp and they fall down into the hole and guess what is waiting at the bottom of the hole.

\[Greta Ross\] It's more food chickens.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] The chicken chickens sit there and wait for the soldier flies to fall, out of the hole and then they eat them. So, You can turn your compost, the compost that the chickens won't eat. You can turn that into Soldier fly larva and then the chickens will eat the soldier. Fly larva.

\[Greta Ross\] This is

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] What we've been told and we're going to give it a try and see if we can get it to work,

\[Greta Ross\] But it's supposed to work.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] We'll see what happens. But we've heard that the chickens very excited because they will sit and wait at the little hole for the soldier fly larvas to come dropping out. Kind of like a gumball machine.

\[Greta Ross\] You know, you put

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] A penny in a gumball machine, you need to turn it in a gumball comes out except there. There you don't have to turn the cranky enough to put a penny in it. The gumballs just keep coming out.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] So that's something. We'll send you, we'll send you a movie. Okay, all right. Soldier flies, climbing up and then dropping down. And, And having a snack is,

\[Greta Ross\] Isn't this something how the good Lord has developed things for every animal? Planned. I mean, For them. Find food.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Yeah. Well, chickens need a lot of help fighting food. You know, unless they're, I mean running around here, I'm not sure they'd be able to find much of anything, if they would want to eat. I

\[Greta Ross\] Think they learn in a hurry though. That no need of going there. There's no food there, they would. Well,

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] They figured out. They spend a lot of time ripping up any vegetation to see if there's something underneath it that the like this beautiful grass here. If the if you had chickens that beautiful grass would be gone. Because

\[Greta Ross\] What would be okay,

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Well, they will eat it, they will eat the grass and then they will dig in the dirt looking for worms. Until it's just a big dirt pile. That's what happened to our side yard. We had a nice layer of grass and then we got chickens and that was the end of the grass. We don't have, we don't have, we didn't have even to this day. We still do not have grass back there. I have to spread out wood chips. Uh, and that the wood chips were great. You know, it's all it. Soaks up all the water and keeps it from turning into a big muddy mess.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] But uh, no grass.

\[Janell Niemann-Ross\] Yeah, so

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] We're gonna have to start bringing food in for him. And hopefully, we'll be able to find. You know, we go to grocery stores. That, um, and we ask them, we will go to grocery stores and ask them for Their trimmings, their Leaf trimmings and because chickens love lettuce. And they love watermelon and they love any sort of protein. You can give them things like old sausages. Uh, Stuff like that. So we will we'll go ask for the old, the old vegetables that the grocery store isn't going to sell anymore

\[Greta Ross\] And

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Maybe we'll go feed them to the chickens because

\[Greta Ross\] That's what you need. Our chickens. To produce there, huh? Well, we

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] We have the option of having chickens

\[Greta Ross\] And then we'll have

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Eggs.

\[Greta Ross\] Okay,

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Yeah, we're not going to raise them for food. Now, we're not going to raise them like for chicken dinners. Uh, that's just too much work. And then you have to then you have to kill the chickens, right? Used to kill chickens on the farm, didn't you? Did you kill chickens on the farm? Yeah,

\[Greta Ross\] Not very many. Um, that was not.

\[Greta Ross\] Process, I guess. Oh, did

\[Janell Niemann-Ross\] You guys have did Grandpa and Grandma have chickens? Once or twice? Yeah, I don't recall having going into

\[Greta Ross\] Having the tavern It made so much extra work for Dad and Mom. Yeah, that they soon. Gave that up. Yeah, even mom had chicken fry. And she gave it up for, yeah, buying chickens. Yeah,

\[Janell Niemann-Ross\] Yeah.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Right. Did she buy live chickens? Or did she buy processed chickens?

\[Greta Ross\] Right. I think. And then she

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Had to process them. Then she had to pluck them and butcher him. Well,

\[Greta Ross\] Yeah, yeah. For

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Chicken dinner and you she was having a chicken dinner once a week, right?

\[Janell Niemann-Ross\] Saturday nights. I think wasn't it on Saturdays? Yeah.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] A big chicken dinner. And I heard like people would order half a chicken. Yeah.

\[Greta Ross\] Well, I think you're hearing Talk about. Oh, who was that gentleman? Would eat two halves. He

\[Janell Niemann-Ross\] A pretty big guy. He

\[Greta Ross\] Worked at. Oh, what big concern is that at Medford I even forgot. That's so long ago.

\[Greta Ross\] Yeah, he was our first customer usually. And he had.

\[Greta Ross\] That took me about quarter two. Oh quarter to seven or earlier. So we had to be ready to go. Yes, that time and Oh, we had to mix up the batter and she took these chickens were plucked. You know, they were cleaned and stuff at that time, but they still had to have that.

\[Greta Ross\] Oh oh, would you kind of go through? Seeing your Fairfield feathers little

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Pin feathers.

\[Greta Ross\] Yeah

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Right. Yeah.

\[Greta Ross\] Pull out those

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Little tiny pin feathers that are all over the place

\[Greta Ross\] And of course

\[Greta Ross\] I don't know how many men. Months, it would be. Excuse me. Well it would be chicken cleaning day. Yeah. Okay. So, um, and I don't know, I don't remember how many chicken they cleaned on that one day. Quite a few. And my mood wraps them.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Yeah,

\[Greta Ross\] In rap or rapper paper. Um, I can't think what I'm thinking of. Um, And then of course, they interrupt them good in. Puts them into the freezer. Would freeze them all. Okay, I was

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Just going to ask. How did you keep them? Yeah. So you'd freeze them all you had a freezer. Did you have an ice house or a freezer? A

\[Greta Ross\] Freezer? Okay. All right.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] And then we would

\[Greta Ross\] Have to make sure that we took them out in the morning, so that the thought.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Yeah, in the

\[Greta Ross\] Afternoon. So we could again

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Have dinner and,

\[Greta Ross\] Uh,

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Oh, pick all the The little pin feathers out, right?

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Right. Oh, really, what would you ever chase somebody away from the bar? Always

\[Greta Ross\] Because Dad was always around. Yeah. Especially he did the chores, the milk milking. Change clothes and came in and tended far.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Uh-huh. Okay.

\[Greta Ross\] So often real often he was around. Yeah.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] And,

\[Greta Ross\] I just, I learned my father's comments and actions and pretty soon. I

\[Greta Ross\] There's a lady standing over there. Watch, watch your talk. Well, I know

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] I'm imagining that some of the folks that showed up at the tavern were just getting off of work.

\[Greta Ross\] Let me see, how can I answer you that way?

\[Greta Ross\] I think the Had taught a lot of them that if they wanted chicken. That's what they're getting you that night. So somebody had to go get it. Okay. So they maybe trapped the mint to watch. Zoo talk and stuff. I, I have no idea.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Oh no, okay.

\[Greta Ross\] Yeah,

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Did anyone come to get chicken? Did anyone bring their family to come get chicken?

\[Greta Ross\] Oh yeah, yeah.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] There was Mom and Dad and the kids and they all came over to get a plate of chicken.

\[Greta Ross\] Yeah. All right.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Yeah. You guys must have had quite a crowd.

\[Greta Ross\] Well, at times,

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Uh-huh,

\[Greta Ross\] Not all the time. Okay.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] But at times,

\[Greta Ross\] Yeah.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Do you think you had? 10 people come show up for chicken or was it 25 or

\[Greta Ross\] Oh, sometimes it's only five at one time. Okay. But usually a little bit smaller. Yeah. Because um, the building was small to begin with, right? And, um, Many times. Dad was out in the barn. So it was just mom and one of us kids. And but then, as soon as dad was able to relieve the bond he did because he need. He knew that somebody you had to be 18.

\[Greta Ross\] Legally.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Yeah.

\[Greta Ross\] To 10 bar? Oh,

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Okay. And you were not 18.

\[Greta Ross\] No.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Yes. But I was

\[Greta Ross\] A member of the family. Oh,

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Okay. So somebody in the family had to be 18. 10 bar.

\[Greta Ross\] Well I had to be a member of the party who owned the business and then you

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Could serve beer.

\[Greta Ross\] Yeah.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Oh interesting. Okay, that works. Yeah, because I know you were maybe were you 16 when you were serving beer in a bar?

\[Greta Ross\] Yeah.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Something like that.

\[Greta Ross\] Maybe even 15. Yeah.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Okay.

\[Greta Ross\] I don't remember.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Yeah.

\[Greta Ross\] But as long as you're a member of the family

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] You can serve beer. Yeah. All

\[Greta Ross\] Right.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] I'll remember that. When I open a I'm gonna open a bar. I'll have my young children come in, 10 10. Does it work for grandchildren, too? I don't know. Okay, I don't know.

\[Greta Ross\] Check your

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Local regulations.

\[Greta Ross\] Yeah.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] I'll have to see. I'm kind of done having children. So I don't think I'll have any more 17 year olds

\[Greta Ross\] And then they think they would believe you. Yeah,

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Well I would have to I think I'll have to talk to the Oregon Liquor. Committee or olcc. I think they might actually have an opinion about that. Yeah. So they

\[Greta Ross\] May

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Not want me to be having my grandchildren come serve liquor. Yeah.

\[Greta Ross\] Because they could get in trouble. Well, we don't want

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] That. We do not want. I don't want to get my grandchildren in trouble.

\[Greta Ross\] Yeah, you know, we talking. I think it's just interesting when you look back through periods of time. How different ones? Handled it.

\[Greta Ross\] So,

\[Greta Ross\] I, I don't know. Mum and dad had this little beer bar on the farm.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] And,

\[Greta Ross\] Many men who work death. A few different. Places. We come yes and pick up chicken. And take one for,

\[Janell Niemann-Ross\] Oh, a takeout. I didn't realize that, but that makes sense. Yeah,

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] They just pick up a chicken and bring it home for the evening.

\[Greta Ross\] It was all done and everything, right? Thank

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] You for picking a takeout. That's great. Yeah, yeah,

\[Greta Ross\] You know, that's that's the long time ago,

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Right? So I kind

\[Greta Ross\] Of forget about Some of it. But well you were

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] 16. What a couple of years ago.

\[Greta Ross\] Yeah. Yeah. And my mom mom is gone, you know? But that woman worked.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Yeah. Do you think you'll see your mom again?

\[Greta Ross\] I'm in heaven.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Yeah, what

\[Greta Ross\] Yeah.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] I don't know either. I'd yeah, yeah. Well, you're you're Catholic. Do they ever talk about what it's going to be like?

\[Greta Ross\] I think Mama and I did. When we would be washing dishes or something, oh,

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Really you talk about what it was like to be in heaven?

\[Greta Ross\] I can't remember. Yeah. That's a long time ago. Well, you'll

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Get to see Gene. Right? When you get to heaven,

\[Greta Ross\] Cuz if if anybody's in heaven, He's in heaven.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Yeah, I think you'll play cards.

\[Greta Ross\] In heaven. Yeah. Well, they better pray for nickels.

\[Janell Niemann-Ross\] And I told Mom we up to quarters yesterday, we up to quarters.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Yeah.

\[Janell Niemann-Ross\] 25 50 and 75 cents.

\[Greta Ross\] Well I I no doubt. It has gotten uh you know prices have gone up.

\[Janell Niemann-Ross\] Yeah, that's right.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Well, I always, I know Gene loved to play sheep head because every time we'd get together,

\[Greta Ross\] You know, everyone

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Would eat and then there'd be this clutch of Gene and all of his brothers

\[Greta Ross\] And he'd have Have those deck of cards in the hand and slap it on the table and

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Yeah, it was time. Now, time to play cards. Are you gonna talk? Are you going to play cards?

\[Greta Ross\] That's right, that's right.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] I remember him saying that once I don't think he told it to me. I uh I was just trying to figure out what the what the game they were playing, I had no idea. It was playing, they were playing sheephead. It turns out. Like, man, they move fast. Well, they they move really fast. Oh,

\[Greta Ross\] Yeah,

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Yeah. So so I, I picture that when when Gene's in heaven, it'll be a 24-hour sheephead game.

\[Janell Niemann-Ross\] Oh, I'm sure.

\[Greta Ross\] And I, I can't Envision them cussing.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] No.

\[Greta Ross\] Him

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] And I think in college that was a little bit different. But once they got married, my dad, he used to smoke a pipe.

\[Greta Ross\] I you remember.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] I have movies Of my dad, smoking a pipe. Um very briefly. It was in college. I think it's just one just like that. Um, I'd have to dig through a bunch of footage to find. Where it wasn't doing it but so he we never had to wait for my dad to get back from the bar because

\[Greta Ross\] He wasn't at the bar,

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] He would check out of work. He worked at Honeywell and he would drive home. And I think it was pretty soon when he got home, we were ready to have dinner. All gathered around the table. Then he would, we would eat dinner. My mom read us devotions for the day and then my dad, read us a chapter from a book,

\[Greta Ross\] A

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Chapter from a book, He would read us. Like he read us the hunting of the snarks. The hunting of the snark. And he read us the brownies.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Well, nothing at least at the wedding. Yeah, but I know

\[Greta Ross\] That you guys

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Got together a couple of times. Probably to talk about the two of us. Just to make sure this is going to work out.

\[Greta Ross\] Yeah. Really that was something for people to get. Get divorced. Oh

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Well I my parents never got divorced. I've never been divorced. Nobody. I well, I know my sister got divorced. My middle sister. But I think she's the only. Person only relative that I've really stayed in contact with, that's been divorced. So

\[Janell Niemann-Ross\] Well, that

\[Greta Ross\] Was that far enough back. That it was an awful thing to do with the partner that you married, really? Yeah, yeah. So, um,

\[Greta Ross\] I don't know. Today, it just kind of changed. People's people did not. Realize the responsibility each one had. Yeah.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Well, you get married and then all of a sudden, you realize, this is, this is gonna take some work, right? Janelle. And I have talked about that where we got married. We

\[Greta Ross\] Were

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Committed enough to our marriage that it. We were willing to put in the work that it took to have to stay married and to have a good marriage.

\[Greta Ross\] Are you saying that? That's, I guess that's how it was for Dad and I it

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Was a commitment,

\[Greta Ross\] You made. Yeah. That was

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Very important.

\[Greta Ross\] Yeah. And and especially when children came along. Sure. Somebody

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Had responsibility

\[Greta Ross\] To those children.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Did Gene ever do anything that made you mad?

\[Greta Ross\] Well, I can't imagine not.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] I'm sure I'm sure he found something.

\[Greta Ross\] Yes. Yeah. I think everybody has something that you get irritated at and soon the other one of the about the couple find out what it is, and boy the spark is, oh yeah.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Well, you have to talk to each other and let each other know, you know. So, I'm trying to remember things that I have done. The mention, I know I, um, When we first got married, I was not a very good cook. In fact, I haven't been a very good cook until just recently. And I know that that may Janelle Just made her crazy. You made her crazy for the food that I would serve her, and it made her particularly crazy to watch me work in the kitchen. She would sit at the in on the edge of the kitchen and make noises, you know like just and roll her eyes.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] And every once while she would just get up and do things like turn off the heat on the stove because she thought I was gonna burn something, which is probably true.

\[Janell Niemann-Ross\] Um you

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Know or she'd like don't put don't don't.

\[Greta Ross\] I don't remember if, um, I don't think I'm pretty much did the cooking. I think your mom.

\[Janell Niemann-Ross\] Well

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] You

\[Janell Niemann-Ross\] Did

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] A lot of cooking in your in your house.

\[Greta Ross\] Yes. I get older

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Did Gene ever cook meals. Don't remember.

\[Janell Niemann-Ross\] And a little ant crawling up by your ear. Oh, is he listening to There you go. Yeah. Yeah, I'm gonna get

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Something else to drink. If you want some more uh, cranberry juice,

\[Greta Ross\] All right, I'll be right back. Yeah, I'll give you this. Oh, you're done.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Okay. All right, take half of that, then. Leave some for you and some for me,

\[Greta Ross\] You know, I actually would have to have a glass of beer

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] When you want a beer. Uh, I

\[Greta Ross\] I don't like that.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] You don't like it, okay? Okay. Should I go find it? See if I can find you a beer.

\[Janell Niemann-Ross\] Oh, we have a oh, did we bring any of the nuclearis? Probably not.

\[Greta Ross\] I

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Left it at Lonnie's.

\[Greta Ross\] What else is in there?

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] I know where there's beer. Over in the Small. Or the. Independent Wing, they have beer in the refrigerator.

\[Janell Niemann-Ross\] They do, yeah.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Do you really want a beer?

\[Greta Ross\] I would drink a glass of beer but I am not. I don't want a big bottle.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] No, no. That's that's just too much are we sure we're not. Um, I, you know what? I will go find you a beer. Because that's the least I can do.

\[Greta Ross\] Give me a minute. I need

\[Janell Niemann-Ross\] To go inside the side for internet to open up registration for Jeff putterman

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Okay I'll be right back.

\[Janell Niemann-Ross\] All right you

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Do that. And I'll in fact why don't you go see if there's beer in the fridge

\[Greta Ross\] Okay? All right, ask

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Carl.

\[Greta Ross\] Where was she gonna? Look at,

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] She's she has to go inside where there's better internet. So that she can change something for somebody who wants to register for a canutra. Your Chanel is in charge of events. For. The paddle Club that we belong to. And so, every once in a while, someone needs help with registering, for some sort of a something, And so Janelle has to get under the internet. And push some buttons. So that that person has permission to do that. It's all very mysterious. I don't get involved. I just say yes honey, that's great. You should do that and she doesn't

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] And then if it doesn't work then I get a phone call. How come this doesn't work? And I have to find out how to fix it. It works out. It's all fine. Yeah. Yeah.

\[Greta Ross\] Yeah I know not much good at any of that stuff. Oh

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Yeah. Well, that's why you have people like me. You know. I offer tech support for my family. I offer tech support for my family. That's what I do. It works out, everybody takes yeah, we take care of it and

\[Greta Ross\] And now My goodness. If you don't know how to help yourself a little better in trouble. Oh well, there's

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] You know, some of that stuff is pretty complex. This like Gene fixing cars. Did you ever have to fix your car? Yeah, Gene. He took care of it for you and he knew how to fix cars.

\[Greta Ross\] Yeah. You know where to go? Yeah well

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] It's the same thing. I don't fix cars. I fix people's computers. And stuff that they do with them. And it's I know how to do that because I've spent a lot of time doing it. So I understand all All the carburetors and all the brake pads. And I I know where that stuff is. So, but I don't think anybody can fix their car anymore.

\[Greta Ross\] I would believe you. Yeah.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] That's become quite an effort.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] But yeah.

\[Greta Ross\] Yeah, seriously, they don't know. The terminology even means

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Right? Yep.

\[Janell Niemann-Ross\] We got a point special here.

\[Greta Ross\] Yep. But it does look like rain, doesn't it? Well, it does

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Kind of it's kind of overcast. Yeah, I know it is like that

\[Greta Ross\] You know once once those terrorists get wet Then it takes so long for them to dry.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Yeah. Yeah. They never quite dry out. Did they? No. Yeah.

\[Greta Ross\] So, we'll find some place where to put them.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Well, I know Lonnie brings her, she has mattress or chair. Cushions. And she brings them in at night. Because otherwise, they get all wet. Ladies, don't they do not. Don't don't do that. They're not what they get wet and that's just not a good idea.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] What are the what are the good sides of?

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Um,

\[Greta Ross\] Kindness should be one of your aims. Um,

\[Greta Ross\] I, I don't know.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Is there a Bible passage? You can remember that you've lived by?

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Kindness

\[Greta Ross\] To each other.

\[Greta Ross\] I went to appropriate school and a lot of these things were taught. To. At school.

\[Greta Ross\] And mainly because I had nuns that I personally liked right and they were quite kind. That carries over, yeah.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Do you remember? Thing that they did. Where you learned kindness?

\[Greta Ross\] I

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Heard a story about my dad. And, Um, it came from a man named Harry Larson. Who was a friend of his at work. And for some reason, Harry Larson told me this story. Um, They were at work. And they were all sitting down for lunch. And one of the people that they were working with, Had forgotten his lunch or didn't have a lunch or something.

\[Greta Ross\] I have a life

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Lunch or lunch had forgotten. They were sitting down for lunch. And this man had not brought a lunch or had forgotten his lunch or something. And my dad opens up the lunch that his with Ellen. My mom had packed for him.

\[Greta Ross\] And

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] He split his lunch. With this guy. He gave the guy half his lunch. And that's stuck with Harry. And in fact, it stuck with Harry so much that he wanted to make sure I knew that Well, Harry wanted to make sure that I knew that story

\[Greta Ross\] Because he told me that

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Story. That's, I remember that as being a story that Above my dad,

\[Greta Ross\] Not stuck with

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Me.

\[Greta Ross\] And we all should be able to do that, isn't it? Essen rule?

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Well, we don't always get the opportunity to do it. Yeah,

\[Greta Ross\] You know.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] And when we do get the opportunity we you know, sometimes kind of let it slip by

\[Greta Ross\] So, I

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Have little stories about that about my parents.

\[Greta Ross\] I or I think it's not a little stories, like you see? Similar to that. Yep.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] There's lots of stories like that and

\[Greta Ross\] We forget that, um, hey, that was a pretty wonderful thing that you did. Yeah. And

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] I think,

\[Greta Ross\] We should complement. These people saw some of these other people who never do it. Realize what a would a wonderful thing it is.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Yeah. Well, you know what strikes me It says that the things that I remember, Are not, you know, the big formal lessons. I don't remember any of the sermons at church. And I don't remember any of the You know, the the presentations on how to be a good person. Um, But I do remember Harry Larson.

\[Greta Ross\] So, it's little stories,

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] The little stories, you remember? And I'm sure when my dad shared his lunch with that guy, he wasn't. I'm sure that when my dad shared his lunch with that guy, He wasn't thinking, this is going to be a story that will shape my children's lives. He just needed to share a lunch with someone. And yet, that's what he did. You know, it's the story that I remember about him.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Are there stories like that about Gene?

\[Greta Ross\] Gene worked down in Milwaukee. Yeah. So I saw him. Not always on every weekend.

\[Greta Ross\] Um, where would you stay

\[Janell Niemann-Ross\] That sounds good. We can sing through Sound of Music again.

\[Greta Ross\] Okay,

\[Janell Niemann-Ross\] That was fun.

\[Janell Niemann-Ross\] With a sound.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Let's talk about going to

\[Greta Ross\] The sing-alongs.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Oh, Janelle. And I went to a very funny, um, performance one time It was The Sound of Music sing-along. The entire theater. Was invited to sing along with the sound of music. And not only that but they gave us a small. Everybody got a small bag of props I'm

\[Greta Ross\] Fine. Props

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Things that we could use during the movie crops. Yeah. Like, for example, Do you remember the scene where, um, Maria is trying to figure out what clothes she needs new clothes for all of the children.

\[Janell Niemann-Ross\] Play clothes

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Play clothes because they all had formal clothes. They needed play clothes. And so she's trying to figure out what to do with the play clothes and she's wants stressing about playing. Well everybody in the audience is told to go reach into your bag, and in the bag is a small scrap of fabric and you were supposed to wave it back and forth. And go the

\[Janell Niemann-Ross\] Curtains, use the curtains is that the film?

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Going like what can I use? Use the curtains and finally she goes like the curtains. So it just goes on and on, take

\[Greta Ross\] The camera, add the curtains and then cut them up.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] She took the curse, she cut up the curtains and made play clothes for the children. Right. And the next scene shows them all running around in the woods with these. Um you know all the boys wearing uh like curtains.

\[Janell Niemann-Ross\] Yeah

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Flowery curtains that you could cut up

\[Janell Niemann-Ross\] All of the curtains. I bet

\[Greta Ross\] That was a hood. Oh it was

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Funny. They

\[Janell Niemann-Ross\] Had little um stems of Edelweiss you know fake um plastic flowers of Edelweiss. And so when the when the song Edelweisserie advice, you got your Adel myself. What else was there

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Curtain?

\[Janell Niemann-Ross\] Fabric? Fatal Vice.

\[Greta Ross\] Where was it?

\[Janell Niemann-Ross\] It was at a movie theater and they played the movie and then we got to sing along, right?

\[Greta Ross\] What was it?

\[Janell Niemann-Ross\] What

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Else

\[Janell Niemann-Ross\] Did they? Because there are probably five or six things in your little. Beg that you could pull out and

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] They would tell you get out them.

\[Janell Niemann-Ross\] Yeah. Not your flowers.

\[Greta Ross\] We're coming up. Okay.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Oh God. Yeah. So yeah and it goes I

\[Greta Ross\] Think they have a good attendance for that. Yeah

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] It was packed you had to buy tickets. And it was, oh yeah, it was standing room only. Funniest thing in the world very popular. Yeah,

\[Greta Ross\] And

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Then I mean but it goes on, it's so long three hours. That movie goes on for three hours. I know

\[Greta Ross\] That's a long time, it's

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] A long time for a movie, you know, and it covers the entire one of me when they, you know, the Nazis take over. And there's the big scene.

\[Janell Niemann-Ross\] Oh, there was something about that, didn't we all have

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Flashlights?

\[Janell Niemann-Ross\] No, I don't remember flashlights, but you're supposed to, you know, show flashlights around

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] The theaters. Maybe not.

\[Janell Niemann-Ross\] Maybe

\[Greta Ross\] You had to take a short snooze then.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] I just remember home, it was just

\[Greta Ross\] I mean

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Now this is the sort of thing. You have to go to and be willing to participate in. You can't just sit there like a bump. And not sings

\[Greta Ross\] In that pirate. Participants. No,

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] You have to participate. This is a participation thing where you are, you know, everybody else is singing at the top of their lungs. And so long farewell, I'll be to say tomorrow and it's just the whole, the whole theater is you can hardly hear the movie because everybody in the theater is singing so loud.

\[Greta Ross\] Ah, yeah.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] It was pretty funny. Maybe we can do that someday. We can have Carl, do his Sound of Music sing-along?

\[Janell Niemann-Ross\] Oh, okay.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] I think she

\[Greta Ross\] He would enjoy that. Well, I know.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] Carl would enjoy it.

\[Greta Ross\] Yep. Yep.

\[Mark Niemann-Ross\] All right, let's get you taking a nap and we'll get something to eat. We'll come back.
