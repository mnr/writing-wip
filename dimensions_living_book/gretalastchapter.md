# Greta Visits {.unnumbered}

I wake up at two o'clock in the morning. If I open my eyes, I'll admit I'm awake and can't go back to sleep. Janell is ~~gently~~ snoring next to me, which she'll do for another half-hour. I leave her alone to her dreams.

I know it's two in the morning because I heard my father's clock chiming the hour. It's a Seth-Thomas Ogee, built between 1842 and 1913. It has two weights; one for the clock and one for the chime, and it rings out each hour. No fancy westminster chimes; just once for one-o'clock, two for two-o'clock. The clockworks are in plain sight when I open the glass front to wind it up.

I also received a clock from my mother. It is much more ornate and the chime is louder and more melodious. It's clockworks are hidden inside the case and when it rings the hour, it is much more demanding of attention and keeps everyone awake. We don't wind the alarm anymore but I can hear it tick-tock all the way downstairs. My mother always had a habit of waiting up late at night for me to come home from a night of youthful disobedience.

My eyes are open, so I get up. I fiddle with email for a moment, then go downstairs for a snack. I keep a jar of pickled spicy brussels sprouts for this sort of thing. Janell hates brussels sprouts, so I enjoy the treat without feeling like I need to save some for her.

I grab a glass of water and head back to the stairs, passing the living room. I glance over, and see Greta sitting in the red chair. Both her and the chair seem to be content.

My rational self knows Greta is 1,945 miles to the east, sleeping in her bed at Dimensions Living. She isn't here, just as the red chair doesn't manifest ghosts.

"Hello Marky," she says. "What are you doing up so late?"

I sit on the couch and place my water on the side table. "Couldn't sleep," I say. "I'll wait for a bit, then go back to bed. What are you doing here?"

"There's lots of places I can be. I don't have to choose. So I'm here."

"But you're in Stevens Point."

"Some of me is. Some of me isn't. Think of it like conservation of mass. I don't cease to exist, I just fade from one place and show up somewhere else. Tonight I'm here. You'll be happier if you don't try to puzzle it out."

"Do you see Gene?"

"Sure. He's my soulmate. *Always* has been, *always* will be. I know you're thinking as man and woman - but that's just a convenient thing you use to understand how this works. Kind of like your chickens."

...

"Is Janell coming down?"

"I doubt it. I'll tell her you were here."

"Don't bother. I'll tell her myself."
