## The Candy Basket

I live at the far end of the second floor of the independent wing. My mother-in-law lives on the first floor of the assisted wing. Because of this, I regularly travel the length of the building, passing over or through the dining hall, depending on which staircase I choose. If I choose to traverse on the second floor, I pass apartment 237.

The resident of 237 hosts a candy basket in their cubby. The basket is white with a woven handle and some pastel accents. A young child could carry it with ease and when I search the internet, I find it listed as a wedding flower-girl basket, priced at about ten dollars. At the Goodwill thrift store I've seen entire aisles filled with these baskets, each reasonably priced at two dollars. If you shop Goodwill on half-price days and apply your senior citizen discount, you might obtain one for fifty cents.

I have never seen the basket of room 237 empty of candy. Before I became involved, the basket exclusively contained small candy bars. The size of the basket restricts the size of the candy. There isn't room for full size chocolate bars. Instead, expect to find bite-sized treats. Think *Halloween trick-or-treat.* If you need a serious chocolate fix, Fleet Farm is right across the street. There's a gourmet chocolate shop downtown. Plan ahead.

I wish I had recorded weekly observations on the type and quantity of its contents. It would have made a lovely graph, showing candy consumption over time. Before you fault me for careless data science, consider the optics of digging through the basket once a day and writing notes on a clipboard. In good conscience I would wear disposable gloves, which would be all the more disconcerting to a third-party observer.

"Don't worry," I would say. "I'm not mixing mind-control drugs in with the Snickers bars."

I might as well wear a white lab coat and eye protection and sneak around after 6:00 p.m. This would surely alarm my fellow residents and possibly start conspiracy theories.

Instead, I performed a rather unstructured experiment. I purchased peanut butter cups (a personal favorite) and stealthily contributed to the basket. Discovering their absence the next day was every bit as exciting as finding Santa had consumed the cookies and milk my sisters and I had laid out on Christmas Eve. Without counting (again, creepy behavior) I observed my contribution was more popular than other brands. Huzzah!

But bags of individually wrapped fun-size chocolates cost about four dollars and last about two days. This rate of consumption would quickly exceed the value of my research grant, so I looked for alternatives. I found two options: Dum Dums, which are small suckers and cost about half the price of small chocolate bars. Tootsie Roll Midgees provide an overwhelming piece per dollar value. I purchased a bag of each and seeded the basket.

My experimentation immediately encountered a problem; nobody in my community likes Dum Dums or Tootsie Rolls. They are just obstructional flotsam my friends dig through in their search for chocolate. If you have squirrels digging in your garden, you're familiar with the holes and mounds they make. This is the same phenomenon I've seen in this candy basket. Holes and mounds. Chocolate bars are picked out; the Dum Dums and Tootsie Rolls remain behind.

This may be related to the dental health of my elder friends; Tootsie Rolls can be problematic for loose fillings or uncertain dental implants. I don't have a workable hypothesis to explain the dearth of Dum Dum consumption, but it may be related to Kojack's trademark tough-guy sucker-sucking style. If you're going to wander the halls with a sucker sticking out of your mouth, you need to do it with a bit of attitude.

I thought of including healthier snacks; bags of nuts, dried fruit, veggie chips. These are on the low end of piece per dollar but I suspect they won't be much more popular than Tootsie Rolls.

But I may be missing the point. The candy basket belongs to the resident of room 237. They aren't running a hotel mini-bar. They are sharing their hope for a brighter world where we offer small gifts to the people around us. Maybe I shouldn't tamper with their universe.
