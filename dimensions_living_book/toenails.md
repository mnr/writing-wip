# Toenails {.unnumbered}

I wish I could remember how this happened, but here I am in a robotic massage chair, my feet in a bucket of water, and Greta next to me at the Mani-Pedi shop. All of the other women in the shop are trying to to point and laugh, but they aren't doing a very good job.

I don't care what they think. I'm having a moment with Greta.

Greta likes to look good. Her hair is quaffed and she pays attention to how she is dressed. Her fingernails and toenails are trimmed, polished, and painted. Greta is a classy woman.

In contrast, I have doggedly curated the look of someone who just stepped out of the woods. I trim my nails with a swiss army knife, my pants are ripped in non-fashionable places, and I wear a shirt when I must.
