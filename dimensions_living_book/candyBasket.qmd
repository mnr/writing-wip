# Hallways {.unnumbered}

There are seven hallways in the residence where I live; three are in the assisted living wing, three are in the independent wing, and one is in the memory wing. Each hallway services six or more rooms. Each room has a door with a small cubby to the side. It's a blank space that invites personal expression by the occupant of the room. Most cubbies have pictures of Jesus or Mary. Many have ceramic dogs or cats (but not both). There are plants and flags and war memorabilia and ceramic figures and wind chimes and drawings by grandchildren.

A few have artwork created by the occupant; our neighbor Jan paints mandala patterns on rocks. Dave Smith, an art professor and member of my community, dabbled in an abstract type of art he described as *Scarabocchio*--Italian for *scribble*. His door was a wild display of politics, opinions, and his multi-colored artwork. His door screamed I AM ECCENTRIC, I AM PROUD OF IT, IT IS WHO I AM. When you are in Stevens Point, Wisconsin, you can visit his museum. I will forever regret not introducing myself to Dave.

I have not seen any lawn flamingos, neon beer signs, dancing hula girls, gum ball machines, coin-operated video games, or historical plaques.

A few cubbies host bird houses. There are no birds flying loose in our building and so the bird houses are empty. But do not underestimate the resourcefulness of my fellow residents. The facility excursion bus makes a weekly trip to a shopping mall. The mall contains a pet store. The pet store contains birds. It's a wonder we aren't infested with a growing population of parrots.

For our cubby, I considered an inflatable flappy-arm guy like you see at tire and furniture stores. At 20 feet tall this would crowd against the eight-foot ceiling, plus the one-horsepower fan might generate more noise than my neighbors will tolerate. Instead, I may purchase a target-practice deer with replaceable core from Fleet Farm across the street.

Until I act otherwise, our cubby hosts a Buddha. This isn't because we're Buddhists. We just happen to have a garden Buddha in our borrowed household items. And it seems fair to offer equal representation for other faiths. We would have posted a garden gnome outside our door if one had been provided for our use.

## Navigation

This story is about my time spent in Wisconsin, but in other worlds, my parents finished their lives in a residence community in Duluth, Minnesota. My father experienced difficulties navigating the halls of this place. There were three possible routes to the dining room, each with additional hallways leading to other wings of the building. There were no street names or hallway signs. Every route was the same color. There were no maps on the walls. He was often lost and frustrated and so stayed in his room.

Streets in older European cities are named, but rarely labeled with street signs. If labeled, they have two (or more) names. You *will* be lost on the first trip from hotel to restaurant. Your only hope is to look for landmarks. In Venice, my hotel was a right turn from the street corner marked by a purple umbrella above the panetteria. In Cortona I went to the main plaza, turned right at the church steps and went up the steepest road that did not pass the gelato store. (Note to tourists--there are many steep streets in Cortona.) In Japan, I kept the drying persimmons to the right, turned towards the cash machine, then opened the door of my Ryokan--marked with the AC/DC sticker.

If I were king of the world, I would hire an iconographer for every residence hall design team. They would comb thrift stores for unusual objects and post them at every corner in the hall: umbrella, cross, bicycle, snow sled, moose head, sailboat, water ski, flowers, train set, wooden spoons, mixing bowl. Wings of the building wouldn't have numbers or letters (Wing A. Wing B...). They would be destinations: California, New York, Florida, Canada, Germany, Australia. Each wing would reflect that location: palm trees, subways, alligators, snow, lederhosen, kangaroos. No words, just pictures and objects and colors.

My father could have stepped out of his room, looked for the bicycle, turned left at the alligator, gone straight until he was in Germany. He eventually realized one route to his dining room was marked by a large mirror at the far end of the hall. Thereafter he arrived at dinner by walking towards himself.

Here at my Wisconsin residence we navigate from cubby to cubby. Leave the dining hall, find the mandala rocks, turn left, look for the blue bird house, then straight on to the buddha. To get to the dining hall at my residence here in Stevens Point, Wisconsin, I walk towards the elevator, turn right, and look for the candy basket.

## The Candy Basket

I live at the far end of the second floor of the independent wing. My mother-in-law lives on the first floor of the assisted wing. Because of this, I regularly travel the length of the building, passing over or through the dining hall, depending on which staircase I choose. If I choose to traverse on the second floor, I pass apartment 237.

The resident of 237 hosts a candy basket in their cubby. The basket is white with a woven handle and some pastel accents. A young child could carry it with ease and when I search the internet, I find it listed as a wedding flower-girl basket, priced at about ten dollars. At the Goodwill thrift store I've seen entire aisles filled with these baskets, each reasonably priced at two dollars. If you shop Goodwill on half-price days and apply your senior citizen discount, you might obtain one for fifty cents.

I have never seen the basket of room 237 empty of candy. Before I became involved, the basket exclusively contained small candy bars. The size of the basket restricts the size of the candy. There isn't room for full size chocolate bars. Instead, expect to find bite-sized treats. Think *Halloween trick-or-treat.* If you need a serious chocolate fix, Fleet Farm is right across the street. There's a gourmet chocolate shop downtown. Plan ahead.

I wish I had recorded weekly observations on the type and quantity of its contents. It would have made a lovely graph, showing candy consumption over time. Before you fault me for careless data science, consider the optics of digging through the basket once a day and writing notes on a clipboard. In good conscience I would wear disposable gloves, which would be all the more disconcerting to a third-party observer.

"Don't worry," I would say. "I'm not mixing mind-control drugs in with the Snickers bars."

I might as well wear a white lab coat and eye protection and sneak around after 6:00 p.m. This would surely alarm my fellow residents and possibly start conspiracy theories.

Instead, I performed a rather unstructured experiment. I purchased peanut butter cups (a personal favorite) and stealthily contributed to the basket. Discovering their absence the next day was every bit as exciting as finding Santa had consumed the cookies and milk my sisters and I had laid out on Christmas Eve. Without counting (again, creepy behavior) I observed my contribution was more popular than other brands. Huzzah!

But bags of individually wrapped fun-size chocolates cost about four dollars and last about two days. This rate of consumption would quickly exceed the value of my research grant, so I looked for alternatives. I found two options: Dum Dums, which are small suckers and cost about half the price of small chocolate bars. Tootsie Roll Midgees provide an overwhelming piece per dollar value. I purchased a bag of each and seeded the basket.

My experimentation immediately encountered a problem; nobody in my community likes Dum Dums or Tootsie Rolls. They are just obstructional flotsam my friends dig through in their search for chocolate. If you have squirrels digging in your garden, you're familiar with the holes and mounds they make. This is the same phenomenon I've seen in this candy basket. Holes and mounds. Chocolate bars are picked out; the Dum Dums and Tootsie Rolls remain behind.

This may be related to the dental health of my elder friends; Tootsie Rolls can be problematic for loose fillings or uncertain dental implants. I don't have a workable hypothesis to explain the dearth of Dum Dum consumption, but it may be related to Kojack's trademark tough-guy sucker-sucking style. If you're going to wander the halls with a sucker sticking out of your mouth, you need to do it with a bit of attitude.

I thought of including healthier snacks; bags of nuts, dried fruit, veggie chips. These are on the low end of piece per dollar but I suspect they won't be much more popular than Tootsie Rolls.

But I may be missing the point. The candy basket belongs to the resident of room 237. They aren't running a hotel mini-bar. They are sharing their hope for a brighter world where we offer small gifts to the people around us. Maybe I shouldn't tamper with their universe.
