# How I Got Here {.unnumbered}

This room is quiet, but not lonely.

To the east are sunny windows shining a pattern of light on a red chair. Miles Davis shares his genius of vibrating the air I breathe. One floor below me is a sidewalk where Tom and Pauline are walking Zero, their Norwich Terrier. Foxes live in the vacant lot to the southwest of the apartments next door. I've made coffee; I can get kitchen coffee from downstairs but mine is way stronger than they are willing to brew.

Janell (my wife) is downstairs with Greta (her mother). They are participating in *drum fit*, an exercise class requiring a chair, drum sticks, and a stability ball. Jenny--from a video screen--calls out rhythms and demonstrates suggested application of sticks to ball. She's a blonde Taiko drummer, infusing her energy into the room filled with senior citizens of limited mobility and stability.

I'll join them at 11:30 am for lunch in the cafeteria. The menu is posted on the refrigerator in this room. Today is beef tips on rice, green beans, a salad, roll, tapioca pudding, and beverage of choice. The kitchen serves me a large quantity because I'm easily the most active resident of Dimensions Living. Most everybody else gets the medium to small quantity. The kitchen staff quickly learns who needs more and who leaves green beans and rice on their plate.
