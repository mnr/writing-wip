# How I Got Here {.unnumbered}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOPE NOPE NOPE...

Greta is losing her mind.

This room is quiet, but not lonely.

To the east are sunny windows shining a pattern of light on a red chair. Miles Davis shares his genius of vibrating the air I breathe. One floor below me is a sidewalk where Tom and Pauline are walking Zero, their Norwich Terrier. Foxes live in the vacant lot to the southwest of the apartments next door. I've made coffee; I can get kitchen coffee from downstairs but mine is way stronger than they are willing to brew.

Janell (my wife) is downstairs with Greta (her mother). They are participating in *drum fit*, an exercise class requiring a chair, drum sticks, and a stability ball. Jenny--from a video screen--calls out rhythms and demonstrates suggested application of sticks to ball. She's a blonde Taiko drummer, infusing her energy into the room filled with senior citizens of limited mobility and stability.

I'll join them at 11:30 am for lunch in the cafeteria. The menu is posted on the refrigerator in this room. Today is beef tips on rice, green beans, a salad, roll, tapioca pudding, and beverage of choice. The kitchen serves me a large quantity because I'm easily the most active resident of Dimensions Living. Most everybody else gets the medium to small quantity. The kitchen staff quickly learns who needs extra salad and pudding and who leaves green beans and rice on their plate.

Stuff to write

I'm a celebrity

## Recruiting

As a resident, I'm allowed to loiter in the hallways, and I frequently do so outside my mother-in-law's door. Usually I'm waiting for her to get ready to go for a meal, but on this day I'm recruiting for my art replacement project.

Her door is located on the main avenue between assisted living and the dining room, so there is a lot of foot traffic. To my left, I see Gladice approaching, pushing her walker.

I'm in a frivolous mood and like a construction-site hardhat at lunch, I call her out.

"Young lady," I bellow. "Do you have a hall pass? I think you should be in class, and if you don't have a pass, you'll have to report to the principal's office!"

Gladice is shorter than five feet, I'm taller than six. She has a curved spine and has to turn her head upwards to stare me in the eye.

"I think you can stick it in your..." Gladice pauses for a beat, then continues. "...ear. You can stick it in your ear!"

She was clearly considering a different orifice, but for the sake of decorum, she chose the safe route. I'm shocked, I say, SHOCKED to hear such a big thing come from such a small woman. We smile and she is on her way. I have decided she is my new logistics director for the great art heist.

Later, she stops by to ask forgiveness for her spicy response. Janell steps in, "Gladice, you said exactly the right thing. You're my new best friend." I'm being ganged up on by the women - deservedly so.
