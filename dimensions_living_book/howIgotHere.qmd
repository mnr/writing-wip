# How I Got Here {.unnumbered}

A capricious fate made me a resident of Dimensions Assisted Living Facility at a mere sixty-five-years old. I'm told I'm an interloper, an outsider to this community with no hope of truly joining for another fifteen years. It's been pointed out to me that my knees still work, that I do yoga balance poses without sitting down, and that I (occasionally) win at pickle ball. I can eat and drink pretty much what I like and I stay up past 9:00 p.m. All are disqualifiers for living with my older friends.

But still, I'm a resident of Dimensions Assisted Living Facility. For two months, I have been the youngest resident of the senior community where my mother-in-law lives. How did this happen?

## **Fun-gi**

My mother-in-law Greta is an absolute hoot. She laughs at my jokes and I tell her stories. When Janell (my wife and Greta's daughter) visits, Greta looks around behind Janell to see if I'm also visiting. If I am, Janell is dismissed and I get the first hug. I've told Greta she is my favorite mother-in-law (she is my *only* mother-in-law) and she agrees that I am her favorite son-in-law. (The other son-in-law may not be aware of this).

Greta is losing her mind. It's more accurate to say she is losing her linear sense of time. As she ages, her brain no longer files events in chronological sequence. Events in the past are classified as dreams, rather than "something I did yesterday afternoon."

She knows this is happening, and it frightens her--it would frighten anyone. (My father was an engineer and when he noticed his diminished ability to remember things, he stopped working on crossword puzzles. He was frightened one day he wouldn't grasp the concept of a matrix.)

So I'm the fun guy. With apologies to the family members who wrangle medications and bills and doctor visits, my job is to make Greta laugh. When Greta is feeling blue, I put on my walking shoes, leave my home in Portland, Oregon, and drive five days to Stevens Point, Wisconsin. I stay for a week, usually longer.

In this case, our stay is to be two months, possibly longer.

## **The Inciting Incident**

The God I worship doth not smite nor crush nor strike down mine enemies. But oh, man--watch out for that omnipotent sense of humor. I'm certain God has a dashboard next to his almighty throne. The dashboard is covered with an infinite number of push-buttons. Each button has the name of one of his children.

When he deems it necessary, he speaks in a booming voice, saying "I have called you by name, you are mine." With a grand circular flourish big enough to encompass a universe, he pushes a button. One of the angels working in Heavenly IT notes a display flashing the words "Custard Cream Pie Successfully Delivered." Here on Earth, these metaphorical pies-in-the-face manifest themselves in many ways. For some, it is a slip on a banana peel. For others, being chased by a rooster through a cow pasture.

God turns to St. Peter with a smile and says, "Would thou likest to wager upon Mark? Five drachma sayeth he will accepteth any crazy idea I sendeth to his path."

With a sigh, St. Peter puts down his clipboard outlining the days agenda. It's difficult to keep an omnipresent deity focused on one task. "Surely I accepth." It's the only way to get God back on track.

God pushes my button and I am hit with a lack of housing in Stevens Point.

## Plot Point One

Janell and I originally try to stay in Greta's room. Dimensions Living frowns upon this co-habitation. We chafe at the closeness of three of us 24 by 7, side by side. This is not a solution.

I investigate long-term residency at the neighboring Holiday Inn: \$3,000 per month. No free breakfast, but access to the pool, weight room, and as many towels as you want. That's a lot of moola for sleeping in the middle of the Clark County Fireman's Convention--or the FFA Regional Expo. Both events are loud and rowdy. Also not a solution.

I investigate AirBnB. There are no month-long stays available. I can string several one-week stays end-to-end, living the life of an urban nomad. We'll spend more time moving than making Greta laugh. This, too: not a solution.

We can purchase a house. We can then furnish the house. We can start gas, electric, water, sewer, and garbage service. Or we can hang out with Greta--but not both. Obviously not a solution.

We can rent an apartment--for a minimum of six months. But no--Stevens Point has no available six month leases. Whether *we* are willing or not, this is also not a solution.

## **The Solution**

Janell and I sit in the lobby discussing our predicament when Jenna, the Director of Marketing for Dimensions Living, joins us.

"I think I have something you'd be interested in hearing," Jenna says.

Janell and I perk up. Jenna is a source of local information with all the important contacts a Director of Marketing needs. She's friendly and we talk with her often. Maybe she's found a spare loft in the warehouse district. Maybe it has a floor and walls. Maybe it has vermin, but those I can deal with.

"We have a spare two-bedroom unit in the independent wing," she tells us. "It's not furnished, but comes with a meal plan. We can give it to you on a limited basis for the price of a single."

This means we would be within a two-minute walk of Greta's front door. And did I mention this is happening during a Wisconsin winter? Any strategy to avoid going outside is favorable.

Janell and I discuss briefly, then realize this is our best (only) solution. We sign and are now residents of Dimensions Living.

In heaven, Saint Peter curses and hands God a fiver. He loses the bet (again). Betting with an omnipotent being is a losing proposition.

## Room 202

This room is quiet, but not lonely.

To the east are sunny windows shining a pattern of light on a red chair. Miles Davis shares his genius of vibrating the air I breathe. One floor below me is a sidewalk where Tom and Pauline are walking Zero, their Norwich Terrier. Foxes (the furry kind with tails) live in the vacant lot to the southwest of the apartments next door. I've made coffee; I can get kitchen coffee from downstairs but mine is way stronger than they are willing to brew.

Janell is downstairs with Greta. They are participating in *Drum Fit*, an exercise class requiring a chair, drum sticks, and a stability ball. Jenny--from a video screen--calls out rhythms and demonstrates suggested application of sticks to ball. She's a blonde Taiko drummer, infusing her energy into the room filled with senior citizens of limited mobility and stability.

I'll join them at 11:30 am for lunch in the cafeteria. Today is beef tips on rice, green beans, a salad, roll, tapioca pudding, and beverage of choice. The kitchen serves me a large quantity because I'm the most active resident of Dimensions Living. Most everybody else gets the medium to small quantity. The kitchen staff quickly learns who needs extra salad and pudding and who leaves green beans and rice on their plate.

## Harassing The Natives

Now that I'm a resident, I'm allowed to loiter in the hallways, and I frequently do so outside Greta's door, located on the main avenue between assisted living and the dining room. There is a lot of foot traffic. To my left, I see Gladice approaching, pushing her walker.

I'm in a frivolous mood, and I summon my best impression of a construction-site hardhat at lunch. I call her out.

"Young lady," I bellow. "Do you have a hall pass? I think you should be in class, and if you don't have a pass, you'll have to report to the principal's office!"

Gladice is shorter than five feet, I'm taller than six. She has a curved spine and has to turn her head upwards to stare me in the eye.

"I think you can stick it in your..." Gladice pauses for a beat, then continues. "...ear. You can stick it in your ear!"

She is clearly considering a different orifice, but chooses a safe option. I'm shocked, I say. SHOCKED to hear such a big thing come from such a small woman. We smile and she is on her way.

Later she stops by to ask forgiveness for her spicy response. Janell steps in, saying "Gladice, you said exactly the right thing. You're my new best friend." I'm being ganged up on by the women - deservedly so.

When she's not telling me to stuff it, Gladice is morose. Her body is failing and she is ready for the Lord to call her home, a common euphemism for death. I kneel down at her table in the dining hall, place my left arm on the back of her chair, my right hand on her arm, and I look her in eyes. She has my full attention and I listen as she tells me what she hopes for.

Once she told me about the "Blue Top Restaurant." Her husband would take her there on special occasions. I gather they had a passionate relationship. She is refined and doesn't share details, but I'll bet with a bit of prodding I could get some steamy tales. I resolve to take her back to the restaurant as a special treat. When I find it on the internet, it has a one-star review with pictures of an semi-abandoned building, peeling paint and chain link fences. It is a grimy shadow of the restaurant she remembers and I cancel my plans. The Blue Top Restaurant has a better existence in Gladice's memories.

## My Muse

When I'm not hanging out with Greta, I write. I'm working on my second science fiction novel. But it's not working. The characters are elusive, the plot is unclear, and I'm unable to force the book into existence. My muse is supposed to be helping me with this heavy lift, but is apparently vacationing at Mount Helicon. (This is prime season to be handing out laurel staffs to the local shepherds. Plus, the skiing is awesome.) I write a sentence, then delete the sentence. Electronic word processors have spared me from having to purchase erasers in bulk.

I assumed my muse would appear in a form similar to Venus De Milo, but with arms. Standing in a serene pasture, she would strum on a harp while enticing me with outlines of Pulitzer-Prize winning novels. I would sit in a comfortable chair and transcribe her words while the literary world clamored to offer me fame and fortune.

Yes, well. Apparently not the case. Instead, my muse has a Master's degree in harassment with a minor in karate. She wears coveralls, carries a clipboard in her left hand and a ball-point pen in her right. She clicks the pen to punctuate her words. She is decidedly not serene.

She unexpectedly pops in one afternoon after Drum Fit. I am staring out the window, watching Zero the dog chase the same squirrel he chases every day. I don't realize muse is here until she slaps me upside my head with a round-house, full-arm swing that catches me just on the top of my skull, pitching me forward and leaving a bruise. If I wore a baseball cap it would go flying across the room.

"Welcome back," I say. I rub my head and stare at her with my best Gladice impression.

"Why are you ignoring me?" she asks. I assume her pronouns are she/her, but since she is incorporeal, they could be anything. "I've provided you with an unending wealth of writing prompts, but you complain and do nothing."

"Writing prompts?" I ask. "I haven't seen anything from you lately."

"Gladice? Greta?" she says. "Red Chair? Bingo? Who do you think got you this place? God is capricious, but he does listen to prayers. Mine at least. And by the way, you're welcome. I'll check up in a week."

Unexpectedly, I have access to a wealth of new perspectives from an older generation. This is the generation who told me I needed a haircut, who told me Satan inspired the Beatles, and who told me astronauts drank Tang. It's also the generation that changed my diapers, let me use the family car, and currently occupies the highest seats of government.

She disappears in a theatrical poof of smoke, leaving me with a room full of stories waiting for my attention. Now that I know how to see them, they become insistent, crowding around like puppies at mealtime. Science fiction will have to wait until I transcribe each of them to paper.
