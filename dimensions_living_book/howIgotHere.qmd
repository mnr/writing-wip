# How I Got Here {.unnumbered}

A capricious fate made me a resident of Dimensions Assisted Living Facility at a mere sixty-five-years old. I've been told I'm an interloper, an outsider to this community with no hope of integrating for another fifteen years. It's been pointed out to me that my knees still work, that I do yoga balance poses without sitting down, and that I (occasionally) win at pickle ball. I'm *only* sixty-five years old, I can eat and drink pretty much what I like, and I stay up past 9:00 p.m. All disqualifiers for living with my older friends.

But still, I'm a resident of Dimensions Assisted Living Facility. For two months, I have been the youngest resident of the senior community where my mother-in-law lives. How did this happen?

## **Fun-gi**

My mother-in-law Greta is an absolute hoot. Mostly, she laughs at my jokes and I tell her lies. When Janell (my wife and Greta's daughter) visits, Greta looks around behind Janell to see if I'm also visiting. If I am, Janell is dismissed and I get the first hug. I've told Greta she is my favorite mother-in-law (she is my *only* mother-in-law) and she agrees that I am her favorite son-in-law. (My apologies to the other son-in-law).

Greta is losing her mind. It's more accurate to say she is losing her linear sense of time. As she ages, events no longer happen in sequence. Her brain successfully remembers important things, but unlike yours or mine, the filing system is not chronological. Events in the past are classified as dreams, rather than "something I did yesterday afternoon."

She knows this is happening, and it frightens her--it would frighten anyone. (My father was an engineer and when he noticed a diminished ability to remember, he stopped working on crossword puzzles. He was frightened one day he wouldn't grasp the concept of a matrix.)

So I'm the fun guy. With apologies to the family members who wrangle medications and bills and doctor visits, my job is to make Greta laugh. When Greta is feeling blue, I put on my walking shoes, leave my home in Portland, Oregon, and drive five days to Stevens Point, Wisconsin. Sometimes for a week, usually longer.

In this case, our stay was to be two months, possibly longer.

## **The Inciting Incident...**

The God I worship doth not smite nor crush nor strike down mine enemies. But oh, man--watch out for that omnipotent sense of humor. I'm certain God has a dashboard next to his almighty throne. The dashboard is covered in an infinite number of push-buttons. Each button has the name of one of his children.

When he deems it necessary, he speaks in a great voice, saying "I have called you by name, you are mine." With a grand circular flourish big enough to encompass a universe, he pushes my button.

A display flashes the words "Custard Cream Pie Successfully Delivered!" Back here on Earth, these metaphysical (*should this be metaphorical*) pies-in-the-face manifest themselves in many ways. For some, it is a slip on a banana peel. For others, being chased by a rooster through a cow pasture. In my case I am hit with a lack of housing in Stevens Point.

## Plot Point One

Janell and I have tried to stay in Greta's room. Dimensions Living frowned upon this co-habitation. We chafed at the closeness of three of us 24 by 7, side by side. This is not a solution.

I investigated long-term residency at the neighboring Holiday Inn: \$3,000 per month. No free breakfast, but access to the pool, weight room, and as many towels as you want. That's a lot of moola for sleeping in the middle of the Clark County Fireman's Convention--or the FFA Regional Convention and Expo. Both events are loud and rowdy. Also not a solution.

I investigated AirBnB. There were no month-long stays available. I could string several one-week stays end-to-end. This, too: not a solution.

We could purchase a house. We could then furnish the house. We could start gas, electric, water, sewer, and garbage service. Or we could hang out with Greta--but not both. Obviously not a solution.

We could rent an apartment. For a minimum of six months. But no--Stevens Point has no available six month leases. Whether *we* were willing or not, this is also not a solution.

## **The Solution**

Janell and I sit in the lobby discussing our predicament when Jenna, the Director of Marketing for Dimensions Living, joins us.

"I think I have something you'd be interested in hearing," Jenna says.

Janell and I perk up. Jenna is a source of local information with all the important contacts a Director of Marketing needs. She's friendly and we talk with her often. Maybe she's found a spare loft in the warehouse district. Maybe it has a floor and walls. Maybe it has vermin, but those I can deal with.

"We have a spare two-bedroom unit in the independent wing," she tells us. "It's not furnished, but comes with a meal plan. We can give it to you on a limited basis for the price of a single."

This means we would be within a two-minute walk of Greta's front door. And did I mention this is happening during a Wisconsin winter? Any strategy to avoid going outside is favorable.

Janell and I discuss briefly, then realize this is our best (only) solution. We sign and are now residents of Dimensions Living. In heaven, Saint Peter curses and hands God a fiver. He loses the bet (again). Betting with an omnipotent being is a losing proposition.

## Room 202

This room is quiet, but not lonely.

To the east are sunny windows shining a pattern of light on a red chair. Miles Davis shares his genius of vibrating the air I breathe. One floor below me is a sidewalk where Tom and Pauline are walking Zero, their Norwich Terrier. Foxes (the furry kind with tails) live in the vacant lot to the southwest of the apartments next door. I've made coffee; I can get kitchen coffee from downstairs but mine is way stronger than they are willing to brew.

Janell is downstairs with Greta. They are participating in *Drum Fit*, an exercise class requiring a chair, drum sticks, and a stability ball. Jenny--from a video screen--calls out rhythms and demonstrates suggested application of sticks to ball. She's a blonde Taiko drummer, infusing her energy into the room filled with senior citizens of limited mobility and stability.

I'll join them at 11:30 am for lunch in the cafeteria. Today is beef tips on rice, green beans, a salad, roll, tapioca pudding, and beverage of choice. The kitchen serves me a large quantity because I'm the most active resident of Dimensions Living. Most everybody else gets the medium to small quantity. The kitchen staff quickly learns who needs extra salad and pudding and who leaves green beans and rice on their plate.

## Harassing The Natives

As a resident, I'm allowed to loiter in the hallways, and I frequently do so outside my mother-in-law's door, located on the main avenue between assisted living and the dining room. There is a lot of foot traffic. To my left, I see Gladice approaching, pushing her walker.

I'm in a frivolous mood and I summon my my best impression of a construction-site hardhat at lunch. I call her out.

"Young lady," I bellow. "Do you have a hall pass? I think you should be in class, and if you don't have a pass, you'll have to report to the principal's office!"

Gladice is shorter than five feet, I'm taller than six. She has a curved spine and has to turn her head upwards to stare me in the eye.

"I think you can stick it in your..." Gladice pauses for a beat, then continues. "...ear. You can stick it in your ear!"

She was clearly considering a different orifice, but for the sake of decorum, she chose the safe option. I'm shocked, I say, SHOCKED to hear such a big thing come from such a small woman. We smile and she is on her way.

Later, she stops by to ask forgiveness for her spicy response. Janell steps in, "Gladice, you said exactly the right thing. You're my new best friend." I'm being ganged up on by the women - deservedly so.

When she's not telling me to stuff it, Gladice is morose. Her body is failing her and she is ready for the Lord to call her home, a common euphemism for death. I kneel down at her table in the dining hall, place my left arm on the back of her chair, my right hand on her arm, and I look her in eyes. I'm making it obvious she has my full attention and I listen. She's sharp, and tells me what she hopes for.

Once, she told me about the "Blue Top." Her husband would take her there on special occasions. I gather they had a passionate relationship. She is refined and doesn't share details, but I'll bet with a bit of prodding I could get some titillating stories. I resolve to take her back to the restaurant. When I find it on the internet, it has a one-star review and pictures of peeling paint and chain link fences. It is a grimy shadow of the restaurant she remembers and I cancel my plans. The Blue Top Restaurant has a better existence in Gladice's memories.

## My Muse Becomes Impatient

When I'm not hanging out with Greta, I write. I'm working on my second science fiction novel. But it's not working. The characters are elusive, the plot is unclear, and I'm unable to force the book into existence. My muse is supposed to be helping me with this heavy lift, but is apparently vacationing in Mount Helicon. This is prime season to be handing out laurel staffs to the local shepherds. I write a sentence, then delete the sentence. Electronic word processors have spared me from having to purchase erasers in bulk.

My muse pops in one afternoon after Drum Fit. I am staring out the window, watching Zero the dog chase the same squirrel he chases every day. I don't realize she is here until she slaps me upside my head. It's a round-house, full-arm swing that catches me just on the top of my skull, pitching me forward and leaving a stinging bruise. If I wore a baseball cap it would go flying across the room.

"Welcome back," I say. I rub my head and stare at her with my best Gladice impression.

"Why are you ignoring me?" she asks. I assume her pronouns are she/her, but since she is incorporeal, they could be anything. "I've provided you with an unending wealth of writing prompts, but you complain and do nothing."

"Writing prompts?" I ask. "I haven't seen anything from you lately."

"Gladice? Greta?" she says. "Red Chair? Bingo? Who do you think got you this place? God is capricious, but he does listen to prayers. Mine at least. And by the way, you're welcome. I'll check up in a week."

I turn my attention from Zero to the stories waiting for my attention. I realize they have been sitting around this apartment the entire time, and now that I know how to see them, they become impatient and insistent.

## The Fly

Everything would seem to be grand, but there is a disturbance in the force. Greta has designated her oldest son as the Power of Attorney (POA) of Finance.

We'll call him "Gary" althought this might not be his real name. (It is). Gary decided he should also be Power of Attorney (also POA) of Health Care and without conferring with his siblings, presented Greta with a document and a convincing argument. Greta isn't as sharp as she used to be and she signed.

You'll need to know a bit about Gary's politics. He is far-right, belongs to the Catholic church, but doesn't believe Pope Francis is the true pope. (Francis believes there is no hell, atheists can go to heaven, being gay might be okay, the church is obsessed with abortion, gay marriage, and contraception.) Gary believes abortion is an inadmissable sin and contraception is denial of God's will. Gary believes death with dignity or euthanasia is sinful. Gay marriage is a lifestyle choice and a sin. He believes in the sanctity of gun ownership. His world does not accommodate ambiguity, gray areas, or "it depends." Gary lives in a nightmarish world where demons conspire against men (not women) and we are going to Hell. Literally. To the place.

You also need to know a bit about Greta's politics. She grew up in central Wisconsin and loved her Dad. He ran a bar and made it clear to his younger patrons that drinking was not an opportunity to harass his daughters. She's seen her girlfriends and sisters deal with date rape and unwanted pregnancies. She knows pregnancies don't always go well. She loves her gay nephew. She's seen men (and priests) misbehave and small town voices hush it up. Greta will tell you we are God's children and we are less than perfect, but we still deserve his love and if God loves us, then who are we to judge?

At this point in the story, I'm hoping you understand why I am willing to drive five days from Portland, Oregon to Stevens Point, Wisconsin just to make Greta laugh.

Greta lived through the polio epidemic. To her, vaccines are a miracle. When COVID vaccines were offered (for *free*) at Dimensions Living, she got in line with enthusiasm. Dimensions Living was required to contact her POA of healthcare--Gary. Gary is convinced COVID is a made-up disease and the vaccine is another money grab by big pharma. When Dimensions Living contacted Gary, he denied permission for the vaccine.

There isn't enough space available on this virtual paper to discuss the responsibilities and limits of a POA, but it's easy enough to know that a POA is responsible for *enacting the wishes* of the person they are responsible for.

In this case, Greta would go back to her room, then in short order appear back in line for a vaccine. Gary was again contacted and again denied the shot. This happened three times before the vaccine clinic ended and the opportunity to return to the line ended.

This is one vignette of the interaction between Gary and Greta. From the above narrative, you can assume there have been many more and they will continue to occur.

I have no power over this situation. Legally I don't have any standing and I'm not a sibling, so I maintain a respectful distance. Greta isn't in serious danger and her finances aren't large enough to be concerned about embezzlement.

But that doesn't fix the heartache I feel knowing she is being unknowingly dragged through someone else's nightmare.

## **5. The climax**

You've built your story up to the climax with rising action, and now the climactic scene (or scenes) will have the highest level of conflict, the greatest tension, and/or the most devastating emotional upheaval.

Several things vital to your climax include:

-   Your protagonist needs to be in the scene(s).

-   Your protagonist needs to resolve the conflict (no other character can do this).

-   The conflict and tension need to be highest at this point in the story.

-   You need to avoid deus ex machina (an unexpected power or event resolving the conflict, rather than your protagonist).

-   The central conflict of the story must be resolved.

The protagonist should face the biggest obstacle in the story and determine their own fate.
