# act 3 - Resolution {.unnumbered}

## Resolving loose ends

Your protagonist may not have achieved their story goal during the Climactic Sequence of your novel. If that's the case, achieving or redefining their goal remains the biggest loose end to be resolved\...but not the only one!

The Resolution of your story should also see your protagonist righting any wrongs committed before or during their journey --- particularly those that stemmed from their core flaw or fear --- as well as addressing the consequences of the Climactic Sequence.

Finally, your protagonist should establish a new everyday normal, one that provides significantly more satisfaction than their everyday normal at the start of your story.
