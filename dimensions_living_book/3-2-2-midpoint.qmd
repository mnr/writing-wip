## Introducing the Midpoint of Act Two

As the name suggests, the Midpoint takes place at roughly the 50% mark of a story. It represents the biggest conflict yet between the protagonist and antagonist (or antagonistic force).

During this conflict, the protagonist comes to realize the true dangers of the antagonist's actions or intent. The protagonist can no longer (or will no longer) ignore the threat the antagonist presents: from here on out, they have to do everything they can to face the conflict head-on.

## See the Midpoint in action

Want to see this game-changing story beat in action? Let's see what our protagonists do when they reach the midpoints of their stories:

In *The Hunger Games*, Katniss --- having been hunted and trapped by her fellow Tributes --- has to take violent action to escape their clutches. This is the event that convinces her to stop running and start fighting to win the Games.

In *Pride and Prejudice*, the conflict between Elizabeth and Darcy comes to a head when Darcy confesses his love and proposes marriage. An argument ensues when Elizabeth refuses. Later that night, Darcy gives Elizabeth a letter that challenges everything she believes about him.

In *The Fault in Our Stars*, Hazel and Gus arrive in Amsterdam, only to discover that her favorite author is a miserable drunk who refuses to answer Hazel's questions. Hazel, distressed and angry, decides to live for what happiness she can get and finally admits her love for Gus.

As you can see, an effective Midpoint hinges on two key elements:

1.  The conflict between the protagonist and antagonist, and\...

2.  The potential consequences --- a.k.a. the stakes --- should the antagonist achieve their goal.
