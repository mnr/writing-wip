# act 2 - post-midpoint {.unnumbered}

Remember, after the events of the Midpoint, the protagonist shifts from *reacting* to conflict to *actively* pursuing it. They do this because they know that directly opposing the antagonist (or antagonistic force) is the only way to protect themselves and/or others.

## An internal shift

During the Post-Midpoint Rising Action, the protagonist no longer waits to confront the antagonist. This may precipitate the action around this point. Several plot points --- or significant events --- will occur between your story\'s Midpoint and the end of Act Two. They will churn readers ever faster toward your story\'s climax as your protagonist make strides toward both achieving their goal and overcoming the antagonist.

Typically, these strides will bolster your protagonist\'s confidence and resolve, continuing to strengthen the shift in mindset that they experienced during your story\'s Midpoint. *However*, despite all this progress, a devastating loss looms just over the horizon. It's one that will threaten to derail your protagonist\'s entire journey...

But more on that tomorrow! For now, let's turn to some examples.
