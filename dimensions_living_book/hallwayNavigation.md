# Hallways {.unnumbered}

There are seven hallways in the residence where I live; three are in the assisted living wing, three are in the independent wing, and one is in the memory wing. Each hallway services six or more rooms. Each room has a door with a small cubby to the side. It's a blank space that invites personal expression by the occupant of the room. Most cubbies have pictures of Jesus or Mary. Many have ceramic dogs or cats (but not both). There are plants and flags and war memorabilia and ceramic figures and wind chimes and drawings by grandchildren.

A few have artwork created by the occupant; our neighbor Jan paints mandala patterns on rocks. Dave Smith, an art professor and member of my community, dabbled in an abstract type of art he described as *Scarabocchio*--Italian for *scribble*. His door was a wild display of politics, opinions, and his multi-colored artwork. His door screamed I AM ECCENTRIC, I AM PROUD OF IT, IT IS WHO I AM. When you are in Stevens Point, Wisconsin, you can visit his museum. I will forever regret not introducing myself to Dave.

I have not seen any lawn flamingos, neon beer signs, dancing hula girls, gum ball machines, coin-operated video games, or historical plaques.

A few cubbies host bird houses. There are no birds flying loose in our building and so the bird houses are empty. But do not underestimate the resourcefulness of my fellow residents. The facility excursion bus makes a weekly trip to a shopping mall. The mall contains a pet store. The pet store contains birds. It's a wonder we aren't infested with a growing population of parrots.

For our cubby, I considered an inflatable flappy-arm guy like you see at tire and furniture stores. At 20 feet tall this would crowd against the eight-foot ceiling, plus the one-horsepower fan might generate more noise than my neighbors will tolerate. Instead, I may purchase a target-practice deer with replaceable core from Fleet Farm across the street.

Until I act otherwise, our cubby hosts a Buddha. This isn't because we're Buddhists. We just happen to have a garden Buddha in our borrowed household items. And it seems fair to offer equal representation for other faiths. We would have posted a garden gnome outside our door if one had been provided for our use.

## Navigation

This story is about my time spent in Wisconsin, but in other worlds, my parents finished their lives in a residence community in Duluth, Minnesota. My father experienced difficulties navigating the halls of this place. There were three possible routes to the dining room, each with additional hallways leading to other wings of the building. There were no street names or hallway signs. Every route was the same color. There were no maps on the walls. He was often lost and frustrated and so stayed in his room.

Streets in older European cities are named, but rarely labeled with street signs. If labeled, they have two (or more) names. You *will* be lost on the first trip from hotel to restaurant. Your only hope is to look for landmarks. In Venice, my hotel was a right turn from the street corner marked by a purple umbrella above the panetteria. In Cortona I went to the main plaza, turned right at the church steps and went up the steepest road that did not pass the gelato store. (Note to tourists--there are many steep streets in Cortona.) In Japan, I kept the drying persimmons to the right, turned towards the cash machine, then opened the door of my Ryokan--marked with the AC/DC sticker.

If I were king of the world, I would hire an iconographer for every residence hall design team. They would comb thrift stores for unusual objects and post them at every corner in the hall: umbrella, cross, bicycle, snow sled, moose head, sailboat, water ski, flowers, train set, wooden spoons, mixing bowl. Wings of the building wouldn't have numbers or letters (Wing A. Wing B...). They would be destinations: California, New York, Florida, Canada, Germany, Australia. Each wing would reflect that location: palm trees, subways, alligators, snow, lederhosen, kangaroos. No words, just pictures and objects and colors.

My father could have stepped out of his room, looked for the bicycle, turned left at the alligator, gone straight until he was in Germany. He eventually realized one route to his dining room was marked by a large mirror at the far end of the hall. Thereafter he arrived at dinner by walking towards himself.

Here at my Wisconsin residence we navigate from cubby to cubby. Leave the dining hall, find the mandala rocks, turn left, look for the blue bird house, then straight on to the buddha. To get to the dining hall at my residence here in Stevens Point, Wisconsin, I walk towards the elevator, turn right, and look for the candy basket.
