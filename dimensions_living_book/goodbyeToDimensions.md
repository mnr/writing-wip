# Only Two Months {.unnumbered}

Janell and I have an open-ended lease of this apartment and could stay here as long as we wish. It's expensive, but comfortable and convenient. We've provided 24x7 physical therapy for Greta and made an enormous difference in her quality of life. It's a tempting place to spend a year.

But we have a life in Portland. We have friends, an ocean, a house, a neighborhood. Our neighbor dog sticks his head through a hole in the fence and whines for biscuits. Our chickens lay eggs. We belong to clubs and a church. All of that is on hold until we return. We can't do it online.

We've explained this to Greta, but we know her weakening grasp of *now* versus *then* versus *tomorrow* blurs her awareness of the pending change in her life. She is accustomed to us appearing before breakfast to wake her up, then seeing her through the day until it is time for bed. Today is the last day this will happen.

I'm watching Zero chase the local squirrel for the last time this summer, possibly this year, possibly forever, depending on Tom and Pauline (Tom and Pauline own Zero). Everything we bought from Goodwill has been returned.

One of our last acts is saying goodbye to our friends. This takes too long, but should go on forever. We lurk through the building, saying hello and goodbye. But oh, that final walk through the dining hall is hard.

I exchange last jokes and stories and move from table to table. I look into Margaret's eyes. I swap quips with the ladies of table number one. But the best moment is when Charles walks by.

Charles watches too much opinion television and likes to discuss the latest conspiracies. He wears a baseball cap. I first met Charles when he called me over at lunch one day early in our stay;

"Hey, are you from Portland?" Charles shouted.

I wasn't sure where this would lead, but I responded positively.

"What are you doing about all those homeless people?" he asked. At the time, this was a hot topic for opinion television. The TV discussion was peppered with the terms "trash," "criminals", and "drug addicts." The newscast displayed streets with rows of tents, disheveled men, and piles of dismembered bicycles.

"That's a tough question," I responded. "We're trying to figure out how best to help all the children stuck in poverty and veterans with PTSD from their war experiences."

Charles stopped mid-response. His hat displays the name of his battleship during the Korean war. He may have realized some of those homeless drug addicts on the TV are his brothers-in-arms.

From that moment on, we explored stories with our different viewpoints. We always part with a laugh and agree it's up to us. Charles is a hard-won and most valued friend.

Charles uses a walker, and deviations from a direct path are an extra effort for him. Today, he gets up from his table in the corner and begins the walk back to his room. This time he drifts to the right, away from the exit, towards where I'm sitting with Margaret.

"I hear you're leaving," Charles says.

"Yep," I agree. "Leaving in about an hour."

"Well... I'm going to miss you." That's it. He heads towards the exit. But what more does he need to say? It's a sonnet in six words.

This is the last time I will see some of these friends, but I don't know whom. Some of the most sickly will be here when we visit again. Some of our healthy friends will not.

When my parents were still alive, I was sitting in their living room, talking with them about the extensive collection of art, furniture, books, and souvenirs in their house. When it came time to move them to assisted living, it would be my task to move all of their stuff. I encouraged them to give it to charities or Goodwill.

"You should take the things you want," said my mother. I lived in the other corner of the country, three thousand miles away. Hauling keepsakes across that distance was impractical. Besides, I had a house full of my own possessions.

"Thanks, but that's just not possible," I said.

"Don't worry," my dad responded to my mom. "When you die, I'll just back up a dumpster and throw everything away."

My father never hit my mother or abused her in any way. But this time, I don't know why he didn't just reach over and slap her. From her expression, his comments were just as painful.

My father was tossing out more than art and furniture. My mother had carefully bestowed meaning onto each item. Like an urn filled with the cremated ashes of a beloved relative, each dish and each chair contained the echo of a precious person, place, or thing. We could point to any item and she would relate the story of a picnic with a special friend, or the time she went to visit her favorite aunt's house and had a special cookie with tea.

Throwing out the broken rocking chair would end the physical existence of Grandma Dietze. The painting of *Christina's World* hung above the dry sink was the last gift from a now-deceased friend. The tin pie cabinet was rescued from her mother-in-law's back porch in Cook, Nebraska before the family house was sold. These objects were the last evidence any of this had happened.

For us, today, leaving was the equivalent of backing a dumpster up to the front door of Evergreen Meadows Senior Community. All the marbles, figurines, medallions, agates, walkers, and jewelry that remind me of the residents would be at risk. Every day, one of those trinkets might disappear, along with the memory of that resident.

I don't know if Charles's baseball cap will go missing. I don't know if he will be here when I get back. It makes leaving here all the more difficult. I've unwittingly made a second life and I can't have both this life in Stevens Point, Wisconsin and my other life in Portland, Oregon.

Janell and I say (another) final goodbye to Greta in her room, then walk towards the front door. It's not a linear path, but is affected by the gravity of friends sitting in the front hall, heading to lunch, or on their way to bingo. It takes a well-spent hour to move across the lobby. Outside, we chat with the ladies watching the parking lot, another fifteen minutes. It's as if we have nowhere else to be. Certainly no where else more important. Our car is just over there, full of travel gear and ready for the five-day drive to the Pacific Coast. We sit in the front seat of our car, take a deep breath and turn the key. The engine starts and we turn to the west.
