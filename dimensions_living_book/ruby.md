# Ruby {.unnumbered}

Ruby's legs are short and she has some trouble walking, but manages to get where she wants to go and get there when she wants to be there. You might wish for more rapid progress towards a destination, but that's something you want - not Ruby.

Ruby frequently visits Dimensions Living. Her many friends know when to expect her visit and gather together in one place so as not to inconvenience her. They chat and socialize. Ruby doesn't always understand the conversation, but is always attentive and interested. What more could you want from a good friend?

Greta has never been friendly with Ruby's ilk. Greta tolerates her visits, but doesn't really want her around. Ruby senses this stand-offishness and works extra hard to win Greta's favor. I've never seen much progress, but Ruby does her best.

Ruby has large brown eyes framed by her brown hair. Her facial features are arranged loosely around her head. Her nose and ears are located where they are supposed to be, but not in a way that we think represent timeless beauty. She does not wear earrings but never leaves the house without a necklace.

She wears a thick coat. The same coat, both winter and summer. It would seem to be too warm on some days during the summer, but she wears it anyways. I doubt she considers taking it off.

Ruby never fails to make a stop by memory care. Some of her friends have recently moved there and she likes to touch base with them. She checks their room to see if they are sleeping, then wanders down to the central area. Like a good conversationalist, she wanders from resident to resident, inquiring about their health and providing comfort.

Visits only last so long until Ruby gets tired and needs a nap. She gets a ride back home and retires to the couch. The TV may be displaying a game show, but she doesn't much care about all the yelling and excitement.

In her dreams, Ruby chases birds. She wags her tail and thinks about dinner.
