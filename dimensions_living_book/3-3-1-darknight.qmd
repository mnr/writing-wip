# act 3 - dark night of the soul {.unnumbered}

Welcome to the third and final act of the 3-Act Story Structure!

Act Three picks up where Act Two leaves off, and it flows through to the very last page of your book. If Act One was the introduction and Act Two was about the opposition, Act Three is all about resolution.

But rather than kicking off Act Three by tying up loose ends, we're going to stir things up. Why? Because your protagonist has yet to address their core flaw or fear --- and it's about to come back to bite them.

This is the beat in which your antagonist comes roaring in. After recognizing the protagonist's growing strength, your antagonist rallies to deliver a shocking blow moments before the climax, blindsiding your protagonist.

This blow forces your protagonist to face their core flaw or fear --- or give up everything they've worked so hard to achieve.

## The power of the Dark Night

Though the Dark Night of the Soul is often short in length, this key turning point is immensely powerful. 

It's this event that will reiterate your antagonist's power, reinforce or upgrade your story's stakes, and establish your protagonist's full development as the story's hero.

## Examples from literature

Not convinced? Check out these powerful examples from literature (spoilers ahead, as always!):

In *The Hunger Games,* Katniss realizes that the mutated hounds chasing her bear striking resemblances to deceased Tributes, including those she killed, dredging up trauma Katniss suppressed to survive.

In *Pride and Prejudice*, Elizabeth is forced to confront her feelings for Mr. Darcy when his haughty aunt arrives, demanding Elizabeth state she will never accept a marriage proposal from her nephew.

In *The Fault in Our Stars*, Hazel must confront the inevitability of death --- which she has repressed throughout her battle with cancer --- when Augustus dies.

## It's always darkest before dawn

Fortunately for your protagonist, the Dark Night of the Soul --- while proving to be a make-or-break moment --- is unlikely to be the end of their journey. 

All that newfound strength and confidence will help your protagonist finally address the core flaw or fear that has plagued them for so long. From the ashes, they will rise --- stronger than ever --- to leap headfirst into the Climactic Sequence of your story.
