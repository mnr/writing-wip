# My Muse {.unnumbered}

When I'm not hanging out with Greta, I write. I'm working on my second science fiction novel. But the characters are elusive, and I'm unable to force the book into existence. My muse is supposed to help me with this heavy lift, but is apparently vacationing at Mount Helicon. (This is prime season to be handing out laurel staffs to the local shepherds. Plus, the skiing is awesome.) I write a sentence, then delete the sentence. Electronic word processors have spared me from having to purchase erasers in bulk.

Early in my writing career, I assumed my muse would appear in a form similar to Venus De Milo--but with arms. Standing in a green pasture, she would strum on a harp while narrating outlines of Pulitzer-Prize winning novels. I would sit in a comfortable chair and transcribe her words while the literary world clamored to offer me fame and fortune.

Yes. well. Apparently not the case.

Instead, my muse has a Master's degree in harassment with a minor in karate. She wears coveralls, carries a clipboard in her left hand and a ball-point pen in her right. She clicks the pen to punctuate her words. She is decidedly not serene.

She unexpectedly pops in one afternoon after Drum Fit exercise class. I am staring out the window, watching Zero the dog chase the same squirrel he chases every day. I don't realize muse is here until she slaps me upside my head with a round-house, full-arm swing that catches me just on the top of my skull, pitching me forward and leaving a bruise. If I wore a baseball cap it would fly across the room.

"Welcome back," I say. I rub my head and stare at her with a peeved look I learned from Gladice.

"Why are you ignoring me?" she asks. I assume her pronouns are she/her, but since she is incorporeal, they could be anything. "I've provided you with a wealth of writing prompts, but you complain and do nothing."

"Writing prompts?" I ask. "I haven't seen anything from you lately."

"Gladice? Greta?" she says. "Red Chair? Bingo? Who do you think got you this living situation? God is capricious, but he does listen to prayers. Mine at least. And by the way, you're welcome. I'll check up in a week."

She disappears in a theatrical poof of smoke, leaving me with a room full of stories waiting for my attention. Now that I know how to see them, they become insistent, crowding around like puppies at mealtime. Science fiction will have to wait until I transcribe each of them to paper.

Unexpectedly, I have access to new perspectives from an older generation. This is the generation who told me I needed a haircut, who told me Satan inspired the Beatles, and who told me astronauts drank Tang. It's also the generation that changed my diapers, let me use the family car, and currently occupies the highest seats of government.

## Our Shared Experience

Aging parents are a common topic among my peers. We worry about them and forget to connect their present lives with their past. Taken as a snapshot of this final chapter of their lives, they are simply "old people." Taken as a sum of their whole lives, they present a vibrant community of history and humor.

I'm honored to be welcomed by Greta's community.
