# Sundowning {.unnumbered}

My experience with Greta has always been delightful. Not just positive, I truly enjoy her presence. She makes me laugh, is never judgmental, exhibits all the best features of her Christian faith. So Greta's evil twin was unexpected. We met her after we left the wedding of one of the grandsons.

It had been a long and festive event, attended by the entire Ross clan. There are more of them than there are of me. They all know who I am and they take perverse delight in asking trivia questions about their family history. I should have commissioned flash cards and had Janell drill me on names, birthdays, city of residence, five pertinent facts of each uncle and aunt. At the least I should have practiced drawing the Ross family tree on a large sheet of poster board.

I have a cousin who excels at this game of *Do You Remember?* He will tell you about the party you were at when someone dropped a cake on the picnic table. I will have no recollection of the picnic, nor being at the picnic, nor dropping the cake. At this point, he could tell me any outlandish lie and I would believe it.

But...the grandson's wedding. It was a massive Ross reunion (as are they all) and I was exhausted. I suspect Janell and Greta were as well. We had rented a hotel room nearby, planned to get some sleep, then drive home the following day. We drove off, leaving the kids to the dance floor and wedding hi-jinks. Greta was in the back seat, Janell and I in front.

"I cannot believe I have such ungrateful children," Greta suddenly speaks up in the dark. "I am going to give all of my money to charity and you will get none of it."

This was *not* spoken in a teasing voice. Greta was serious and angry. Greta's norm is happy and tolerant, loving and expansive. This was Evil Greta. Who the hell is in the back seat and how am I supposed to react? Know that I am conflict-avoidant and this was already one large conflict. I was happy to be driving and decided to focus on avoiding deer jumping from the forest.

There *had* been an incident at the wedding. One of Greta's children felt it was appropriate to proselytize to one of the grandchildren and his girlfriend. His words were unwelcome and caused tears, leaving the rest of us to mitigate this emotional exchange. Greta may have heard some of the discussion. That's what I assumed this was about. But Greta wouldn't say what was bothering her, only that she was disgusted with us.

Janell and I didn't understand what was happening. Looking back, there were clues, but we didn't know to look for them. At the hotel, she wanted me to get her suitcase out of the car; I had seen her place it in the closet just five minutes before. She asked twice why we were staying in this strange room.

She was angry and sullen until the following morning when we joined some of the grandkids for breakfast. Over waffles, bacon, and coffee she perked up and we were again in good graces. Evil Greta was gone.

In the next months and years, Evil Greta periodically reappeared. We would receive nasty emails and phone calls. The next morning she would be chipper and friendly. She had no recollection of sending us an email with ALL CAPS ABOUT THE LATEST EVILS IN THE MODERN WORLD!!!!!

It didn't help that she was surrounded by angry voices on the television and neighborhood, convinced the world was coming unglued and Satan was in the White House. She received a daily stream of hate-filled emails, alarming news reports, sanctimonious religious pamphlets. Some of these she forwarded to her children. It was not what I would have expected from the gentle Greta who accepted me for who I was.

When my son was thirteen, he sprayed me with the garden hose. He thought it was funny. I was pissed, and let him know by subjecting him to my traditional family silent treatment. In a brief time, I realized I had broken his spirit and he was feeling bad about himself. I gave him a hug, but realized I had damaged the relationship; there would never be a way to undo the hurt. So it was with Greta - the gentle woman who had given me her daughter's phone number was no longer the same.

In time, we learned this is called *sundowning*. It is an early indicator of dementia, often associated with Alzheimer's disease. It's a real thing, there's research being done. When it happens it is distressing and scary. Janell and I have learned to distract her away from whatever is causing her to be upset. Sometimes I sing a song with her or tell her a joke. I wish I had the joke book her son had memorized for dinner times.

Over a short period of time, Greta became confused with how to operate email and the nastygrams ceased. But this new Greta was living with all of us.
