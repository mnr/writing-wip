## Moth Pitch

*Now click on record and wow us with a 2-minute pitch of your story! Tell us the actual story - not what it’s about or what it might be. Give us a sense of your story arc and how your story changed you.*

*Cliffhangers will not be considered (i.e. “and so begins the story of the greatest adventure of my life”). Go on! Tell us about the adventure! Don’t leave us hanging, because we won’t call you back*

## Recorded - two minutes

For two months, I was the youngest member of my Mother-In-Law's senior residence hall. How I got there is a story for another time. What's important is the Red Chair.

I found a red, leather recliner in the cast-off pile in the residence hall basement. It was in perfect condition–except for the discolored area corresponding to the previous owner's head and faded spots on the armrests.

Without any need for imagination, I can see the ghost of the chair's owner. It stands behind the chair, one hand possessively stroking the head rest. The ghost, with the eternal desire of those who have moved on, whispers a sales pitch. It has an interest in the well-being of this favorite chair.

"*It's mechanically perfect,*" says the ghost.

The chair behaves like any kennel dog being considered for adoption, straightens its shoulders and looks at us with a hopeful expression.

"*You need such a chair!*" concludes the ghost. It pauses, waiting for my decision.

Unknown to me, the chair comes with a history of bedbugs. It has been slated for destruction and the ghost looks to me for help.

With some conniving, I engineer salvation for the chair, transporting it 2,000 miles to a new home.

I take great comfort knowing a chair can have a guardian. If something as insignificant as a mass-produced piece of furniture is cared for, then what about me? Or you? I can only hope for such an advocate when I have bedbugs and become destined for disposal.

## Written Summary

"The Red Chair" shares the discovery and adoption of a red leather La-Z-Boy recliner and its ghostly (previous) owner.

Found in a pile of discarded items at a senior living residence and doomed to disposal, the ghost and my wife plot to save the chair. We enlist the help of a friend and his barn, then transport it 2,000 miles from Wisconsin to Portland, Oregon.

If an insignificant chair can have a guardian angel, why can't we?
