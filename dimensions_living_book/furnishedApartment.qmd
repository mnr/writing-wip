## Furnished Apartment

When Janell and I were first dating, I lived on a porch. In Minnesota. In winter. With no heat.

I did have a space heater. One of those gray, metal, 1,500-watt devices with the two chrome bars in the front, preventing fires if the unit ever tipped over on its face. It tried its best, but was no match for the lack of thermal conductivity from the panoramic view and wrap-around glass.

For a bed I had a two-inch foam pad and some sheets. Possibly a quilt. I was not big on home furnishings.

Janell was repelled by this sub-standard sleeping arrangement, but was attracted by my youthful exuberance. She stuck it out, but this was not to be repeated in our current situation. Once again, I realize how fortunate I was to marry her and put her in charge of improving my common sense.

Instead of a space heater and foam mattress, Janell's sister volunteers her furnishings currently in storage in a ULock facility in Milwaukee. We are free to use her bed, dressers and tables. All we have to do is move it from Milwaukee to Stevens Point and back again.

"No problem," I confidently assure Janell. "The CR-V has a tow hitch, we can rent a 6 x 12 trailer from U-Haul and we'll be set!"

All the enthusiasm, none of the experience.

The U-Haul dealer is willing to believe I know

what I was doing and even left me to attach the hitch by myself. I backed the CR-V up to the trailer then lifted the coupler onto the hitch ball. I tried. I lifted with my legs (not my back). Couldn't do it.

"hmmm...," I pondered to myself. Nobody else was around except the trailer and the CR-V. They weren't talking.

But the CR-V has a jack. Perfect. I jack up the coupler and trailer tongue, back the CR-V up, drop the jack, problem solved. The jack goes back in the car, I connect the safety chain, drive around the parking lot once to check my work, and everything is in tip-top shape. Let's go to Milwaukee!

There is a counseling device called Jahari's Window. It helps people understand their relationship with themselves and others. It is a grid of four squares: two rows, two columns. The columns are labeled "Know to self" and "Not known to self. The rows are labeled "Known to others" and "Not known to others." The cells in the grid occupy the intersection of row and column. Let's use this to examine my current situation.

**Known to others/Known to self:** I am driving to Milwaukee with a 6 x 12 trailer. This is not an unusual thing.

**Known to others/Not known to self:** Janell knows I should be less than confident. I am unaware of anything that could go wrong.

**Not known to others/Known to self:** I seem to be getting low on gas. And my goodness, it is starting to rain really hard.

**Not known to others/Not known to self:** I have neglected to tighten the coupler latch to the hitch ball.

Crusing down the highway at 65 mph (WARNING: DO NOT EXCEED 55 MPH WITH THIS TRAILER) I start to question my pre-flight checklist. Did I put on the safety chains? (yes). Did the trailer tires have air? (yes). Was the trailer empty? (yes). Did I tighten the coupler latch to the hitch ball? (Possibly not. Sure I did. Can't remember. Yes. No.) Perhaps I should check.

Ahead is a rest stop - perfect for checking coupler latches. I turn smoothly and begin to decelerate. Unfortunately, Wisconsin Department of Transportation has neglected their maintenance on this rest area. Potholes. BIG potholes filled with water. Potholes so frequent and so large they are impossible to dodge. I hit one, then a second. I look in the rear-view mirror and see the trailer lurching and bucking behind me. I feel a lurching tug; the trailer has clearly jumped off the ball and is now free to run me down or puncture my gas tank. I sloooowwwly come to a stop, trying not to irritate this 6x12 monster trailing my hapless CR-V.

I manage to stop and breathe. Everything is still on the road, the trailer is still behind me. I get out hoping for the best.

The trailer tongue is in the dirt. It has wedged itself under the car and come to the end of the chain. I don't smell gas and there aren't any unsightly bruises in the bumper. All I need to do is put the trailer back on the ball and we are good to go. So simple.

But the trailer is wedged under the car. I can't lift the car off the coupler. I lift with my legs. Can't do it. Like deja-vue, I remember the jack, which I use to lift the rear of the car, freeing the trailer.

Chock is a funny word. It's a noun, it's a wedge, and they come in sets of four. They are used to keep the wheels of cars or trailers from unexpectedly rolling. In a pinch, you can use a brick, or a stump, or a rock. I had neglected to chock the wheels on the trailer before lifting the car.

The newly freed trailer rolls backwards. I can only watch in dismay - I know enough to not step behind the trailer (empty weight: 1,920 pounds). Today, I am a lucky boy. The chains are still attached, the car is still in contact with the ground, the trailer reaches the end of its tether and stops with a jerk. I resume breathing.

This will be easy to solve. I disconnect the safety chains and pull the CR-V forward. I jack up the tongue of the trailer, then back the CR-V to the coupler. Only this time, I don't jack the trailer up far enough. I only nudge
