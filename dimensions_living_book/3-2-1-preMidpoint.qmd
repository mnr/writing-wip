## Hello, opposition!

If Act One was all about introduction, Act Two is about *opposition*. As your protagonist chases down their story goal (whatever they believe will bring them satisfaction), they\'ll encounter resistance in the form of an antagonist or antagonistic force.

If you\'ve yet to define these elements, I\'ve included a few resources at the end of this email that you may find helpful.

It goes without saying that your protagonist will face many trials and tribulations during the Pre-Midpoint Rising Action. These may include physical roadblocks, opposition from the antagonist, tension among friends, and/or inner conflict. Whichever the case, this beat is often the one in which the opposition forces grow. 

## Hello, reactionary hero!

During the Pre-Midpoint Rising Action, the protagonist is largely reactionary. Their journey is new and overwhelming, and their core flaw or fear still weighs heavily upon them. 

Remember what we said earlier about the opposition? Well, because the protagonist is still reactionary, they typically won\'t take direct action against that antagonist or antagonistic force. They\'ll instead focus all their energy on merely surviving conflicts, so that they can get back to chasing down their story goal.
