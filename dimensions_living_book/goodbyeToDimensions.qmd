In which I depart Dimensions Living

## Only Two Months

Janell and I have an open-ended lease of this apartment and could stay here as long as we wish. It's expensive, but comfortable and convenient. We make a huge difference in Greta's quality of life. It's a tempting place to spend a year.

But we have a life in Portland. We have friends, an ocean, a house, a neighborhood. Our neighbor dog sticks his head through a hole in the fence and whines for biscuits. Our chickens lay eggs when they feel inspired. We belong to clubs and a church. All of that is on hold until we return. We can't do it online.

I'm watching Zero chase the squirrel for the last time this summer, possibly this year, possibly forever depending on Tom and Pauline. Everything we bought from Goodwill has been returned and the carpet is vacuumed for the last time.

Saying goodbye to our friends takes too long and should go on forever. This is well documented in paintings, music, and poetry so I'm not taken by surprise. But oh, that final walk through the dining hall is hard.

I exchange final jokes and stories. I look into Gladice's eyes. But the best moment is when Ray walks by.

Ray watches too much opinion television and likes to discuss the latest conspiracies. We explore stories with our two different viewpoints. We always part with a laugh and agree it's up to us. Ray is a hard-won, and most valued friend.

Ray uses a walker and deviations from a direct path is extra effort. He gets up from his table in the corner and begins the walk back to his room. This time he drifts to the right, away from the exit, towards where I'm sitting with Gladice.

"I hear you're leaving," Ray says.

"Yep," I agree. "Leaving in about an hour."

"Well...I'm going to miss you." That's it, he heads back to the exit. But what more does he need to say? It's a sonnet in five words.
