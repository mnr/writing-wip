# The Independent Life {.unnumbered}

Life in the independent wing of Dimensions Living is akin to a college dorm, without the heavy drinking, overactive sexuality, and loud rock music. Maybe it is - I don't have surveillance camera footage to confirm my assumptions. I do know the male/female ratio is in favor of the men; the odds are good, but the goods are odd.

Greta's apartment has a kitchen and her kitchen has the equipment from her previous home. She has the capacity to prepare a meal for thirty relatives, plus sending them home with a bag of sandwiches for the ride home. Seating might be a challenge, she has a total of six chairs, but I'm sure there's a way to do this.

The unfortunate hair in the lasagna is that Greta has moved in during the Covid pandemic. Dimensions Living is on lock-down. Nobody is allowed to share their viruses and kill their fellow residents. A good call, but a damper on Greta's ability to form friendships with her new community.

But, as Dr. Ian Malcolm dryly observes, "Life finds a way." (Jurassic Park. Look it up.) Dimensions Living simply doesn't have enough staff to police the halls all day and all night.

Bobbi shows up at Greta's door, knocks, and Greta lets her in. Virus be dammed.

"Want to have a beer?" Bobbi asks.

"Are we allowed to drink beer here?" Greta asks.

"I don't know," admits Bobbi. "Let's grab one and sneak into the staircase."

I am not making this up. The Dimensions Living marketing director will attest to the fact of finding Greta and Bobbi in the staircase, drinking a clandestine beer. She asked them why they were sneaking around and got the full story. By the way, independent residents can do anything they damn well please, as long as it doesn't scare the staff. Drinking beer in the staircase, or their room, or the common spaces is allowed. But it's much more fun if it's not.

[note: this is the conclusion...]{.underline}

Greta is nimble. She can stand on one leg to put on her pants. I'm doing yoga balance positions so I can emulate her. So far, I'm about fifty-percent away from crashing into the wall and alarming the household with my feeble attempt at dressing myself. I try not to embarrass myself, but frequently fail.

Greta proceeds through her life with the grace of a ballerina. Maybe I exaggerate; she doesn't have a barre or wall mirror in her apartment. But I dare you to challenge her to a balance contest. She's unnatural that way.

Imagine our surprise when she winds up in the emergency room due to a fall.
