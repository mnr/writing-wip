# **About Mark Niemann-Ross**

Mark Niemann-Ross is an author, educator, and chicken wrangler living in Portland, Oregon.

## *Who is Mark Niemann-Ross?*

I’m friends with technology. But I’m not blindly in love with it. It has to be questioned. It has to be explained. Sometimes it’s just dead wrong. It needs firm guidance.

People are more important than technology. People don’t want widgets, they want elegance and relevance.

I point to the future, explain the present, and learn from the past.

## I write

I grew up in a family of writers. My mother writes, [my sister](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christinesang/) writes and I’ve always been friends with the printed word.

Mostly, I write [science fiction](http://niemannross.com/books-2/). But I’ve also written about [technology in the workplace](https://www.linkedin.com/in/markniemannross/detail/recent-activity/posts/), jazz in Oregon and [dogs in the wild west](http://niemannross.com/books-2/patches-catches-the-sargo-county-cattle-rustler/).

About that [science fiction](http://niemannross.com/books-2/). Sometimes it’s about spaceships, sometimes it’s about products. The goal is the same; explain where we want to be, point out hazards, celebrate arrival.

## I teach

You’ll find [my courses](http://niemannross.com/courses/) on R and Raspberry Pi at [LinkedIn Learning](http://niemannross.com/link/mnratlil). I have a degree in Industrial Education from the [University of Wisconsin-Stout](http://www.uwstout.edu/).

## And…

I’m engaging. Informed. Opinionated. Respectful. I’m an educator, manager, evangelist, marketer, technologist, futurist, coder.
