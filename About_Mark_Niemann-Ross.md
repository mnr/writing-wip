I’m an author and educator living in Portland, Oregon. I [teach](https://niemannross.com/courses/) “R” - a programming language, and “Raspberry Pi” - a small computer used for the Internet of Things. My courses appear on [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/instructors/mark-niemann-ross) and [Educative](https://www.educative.io/profile/view/5411696284008448).

I’ve been playing with technology for as long as I remember. My dad was a design engineer for Honeywell and brought home an early-stage 8080 micro-computer for me to play with. I learned BASIC on a time share system, played with electronics, found out how to reset the house circuit breakers (“Mark,” my mother would shout. “Are you okay? What was that BANG I heard?”) At university, I picked up a degree in Industrial Education, worked in the software industry as a developer evangelist, then re-entered the education world through Lynda.com. I am now a full-time instructor and consultant, focused on R, SQL, and Raspberry Pi. When I have a need, I play with python, R, C++, php and small electronics.

Technology influences my [writing](https://niemannross.com/books-authored-mark-niemann-ross/), which fits solidly in the genre of “Hard Science Fiction.”

I co-authored my first story in 2005 with Richard A. Lovett in Analog, Science Fiction and Fact. Since then, I’ve published additional stories in Analog and Stupefying Stories, self-published [two](https://niemannross.com/books-authored-mark-niemann-ross/phantom-sense/) [collections](https://niemannross.com/books-authored-mark-niemann-ross/humanity-by-proxy-and-other-stories/), and collaborated on a children’s book, [*Patches Catches the Sargo County Cattle Rustler*](https://niemannross.com/books-authored-mark-niemann-ross/patches-catches-the-sargo-county-cattle-rustler/).

Most recently, I published [*Stupid Machine*](https://niemannross.com/books-authored-mark-niemann-ross/stupidmachine/), a science fiction murder mystery solved by a refrigerator.

## Sponsorship is important!

I don’t have to work on things that make an income, so the actual cash from a sponsorship isn’t all that important. But your participation in this little goat rodeo is a way of showing that you value my work. It’s nice to hear from you!

## and so…

I’m a writer and an educator and will do that as long as I can sit at a keyboard. How about you?
