# **About Mark Niemann-Ross**

Mark Niemann-Ross is an author, educator, and chicken wrangler living in Portland, Oregon. He teaches “R” - a programming language, and “Raspberry Pi” - a small computer used for the Internet of Things. Both topics influence his writing, which fits solidly in the genre of “Hard Science Fiction.”

Mark co-authored his first story in 2005 with Richard A. Lovett in Analog, Science Fiction and Fact. Since then, he has published additional stories in Analog and Stupefying Stories, has self-published two collections, and collaborated on a children’s book.

Most recently, Mark published *Stupid Machine*, a science fiction murder mystery solved by a refrigerator.

Mark lives in Portland, Oregon. He does not have cats because his chickens would object.
