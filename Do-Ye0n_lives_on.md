Nobody sleeps on the streets, although Do-Ye0n fantasizes about it.

If he wasn't assigned to this apartment, he could choose where he slept, instead of these recyclable sheets and pillow. He could choose what he smelled, instead of the odor of chlorine and urine from the cassette toilet. He could choose his neighbors, instead of the screaming and thumping of the genetic cesspool collective living on the other side of the shared wall. He could have his freedom.

But he doesn't. And he's stuck here with all the internet he needs.

Not enough for entertainment, but enough to look for work, pay bills, order food-only the essentials. Because he's supposed to become a contributing member of society.

Do-Ye0n is an experienced engineer in artificial intelligence as applied to vehicles. His ranking in the associated competencies assessments places him at 95%. He's known in the industry. He's shunned by the industry.

He has no choice but to open the first job offer of the day. It's a contract gig, just like every other from the past four months. The skills required are beyond a reasonable expectation for the exactly minimum pay offer. But this is what he's offered after trying to hijack autonomous vehicles and probably (*not proven or convicted*) killing two people. He accepts and completes the project in two short hours, completing his daily contribution requirement. Now he can look for better paying long-term work. Day gigs are a gerbil-wheel for losers.

Volume 2

Do-Ye0n lives on

1)  publicly traded ransomware companies
2)  arrests based on profitability
3)  bail as recruitment tactic
4)  betting (short and long) on results of conviction
5)  incarceration by public companies
6)  early release based on job interview and desirability of candidate (prisoner)

Do-Ye0n Kurrat is a penetrative tester in automotive ai security.

Companies hire p.testers to ward off ransom ware. But they also use that tech to spy on other companies - intl and domestic. Which is hard to tell the difference.

Sometimes companies run afoul of politicians. Political slogan : "Screw Them!"

Scapegoats are sacrificed (dyk!). I.e. engineers that designed Volkswagen diesel algorithm.

Prosecution of corporate illegal behavior is a competitive strategy. "If you can't beat them, then jail them." Find a way to lock up strategic employees.

"Our assets walk out of the door each evening. We have to make sure that they come back the next morning."

Dyk enters the criminal economy
