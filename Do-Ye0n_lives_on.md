Nobody sleeps on the streets, but Do-Ye0n fantasizes about it.

Nobody sleeps on the streets since 2052 when housing was made a right.

Nobody sleeps on the streets, but if Do-Ye0n wasn't assigned to this level one apartment, he could choose where he slept. He could choose what he smelled, instead of the odor of chlorine and urine from the cassette toilet. He could choose his neighbors, instead of the screaming and thumping of the genetic cesspool collective living on the other side of the shared wall. He could have his freedom.

But he doesn't. And he's stuck here with just enough internet to do what is required of him.

Not enough for entertainment; enough to look for work, pay bills, order food. Because he's supposed to become a contributing member of society. Or he'll lose his basic rights.

If he loses his rights, then he *will* sleep on the streets, fantasy or not.

Before he loses his rights, he needs to urinate. He climbs out of the bed and steps twice to the bathroom door. He slides the door to the side and considers the sink, toilet, mirror and hand shower. He sits because there isn't room to stand. From his throne, he reaches for the shower which doubles as a bidet. Standing, he looks in the mirror.

The mirror tells him about him. Numbers scroll down the left side; blood pressure, possible diabetes, cancer screening, heart attack, addictions, pregnancy (omitted because he's not and never will be). The mirror scans him for melanoma, wounds, and visible signs of stress. It checks his eyesight, retinas, glaucoma, and cataracts. Preventative healthcare is cheaper than treatment and everyone in level one housing has a mirror feeding health data to a central diagnostic. No choice about it.

Do-Ye0n shakes himself, steps out and closes the door. By default, he is now facing the food storage unit (refrigerator) and the food processor. Do-Ye0n reaches into the refrigerator and pulls out the breakfast provided to level one housing. It's a kind of oatmeal with a packet of banana. Do-Ye0n knows this because it's printed on the package. He puts it in the food processor and turns back to the refrigerator to find coffee.

Coffee is optional. He can eat anything he wants, but if it's not level one, he has to buy it himself. And cook it. Which isn't hard; the food processor knows how, just turn it on. But he doesn't have any coffee this morning.

In only a minute the food processor tells him the thing he placed inside it has been transmogrified into oatmeal. And bananas. Probably.

This apartment doesn't have a proper table. Instead, a panel and chair fold out from the wall. Do-Ye0n can eat breakfast at the table, then clear the packaging, then work, then move the terminal, then eat lunch at the table, then clear the packaging, then...and so on.

If he folds up the bed then he has room to briefly pace the apartment. Before he folds out the bed, he has to fold up the table and chair. Before he opens the door, he has to fold up the bed. He doesn't bother.

Do-Ye0n ranks at 95% proficiency in vehicle AI engineering. Prior to his *almost* conviction he had a level five apartment with a kitchen, living room, bedroom, and a door that could be opened without changing anything else in the apartment. He had a window. He was at the top of the industry. He's known in the industry.

He's shunned by the industry.

Chronic unemployment dropped him back to level one. He knows how far he fell and he wants it back.

He has no choice but to open the first job offer of the day. It's a contract gig, just like every other from the past four months. It requires advanced skills but offers a minimum payout. This is what he gets after hijacking autonomous vehicles and probably (*not proven or convicted*) killing two people. He accepts and completes the project in two short hours, fulfilling his daily contribution requirement. But that payment doesn't get him out of this apartment.

If he can find long term work, he can move someplace that doesn't stink. Day gigs are a gerbil-wheel for losers. He calls up the job search counselor - an artificial coach with a cheery attitude.

"Do-Ye0n," says the coach. His name tag says *Alex* in a comic-book font. Alex has a head, torso, and arms although he rarely uses anything other than facial expressions. Mostly his eyebrows. Alex is not an expensive render - public funds are better spent on other things. Oatmeal and bananas, for example.

"Welcome back!" Alex is enthusiastic and upbeat. His personality is also not expensive. "I don't have anything for your current profile. Would you like some suggestions?"

"Yes. No. How about broaden the industries you are searching. In fact, please remove the automotive sector entirely. It's obvious they don't want me, so let's move on."

"Done," says Alex without hesitation. "Removing the automotive search restriction produces two good matches; cyber security and agriculture. Which would you like to start with?"

"Which pays better?"

"Cyber security. It is corporate network penetrative testing."

"Ransomware, you mean." Do-Ye0n frowns. "What are the numbers?"

"Ransomware is a slang term and not widely approved for this line of work. Corporate network penetrative testing is ranked in the top 30% of compensation plans, includes level four housing and grants stock options every quarter." Alex smiles. It's the only expression Alex has. "The company is named Alpha60 and they have reviewed your resume. They are extending an offer. Shall I tell them you are able to start?"

"Wait a minute," says Do-Ye0n. He needs time to think. Ransomware professionals are well paid, but it can be a permanent career choice. Once you begin performing *corporate network penetrative testing* all future potential employers view you as a possible threat, maybe even a sleeper for a competitor. But that's accounted for in the compensation and stock options.

Not surprisingly, the stock market isn't bothered about this enterprise. Corporate espionage (*ransomware*) has cash flow and can be publicly traded. There are legal issues and occasionally a corporation will step beyond the boundaries, but in those cases, lawsuits are file, a few guilty engineers are punished, divisions are sold off to competitors and the stockholders lose their investment. It's the same as any other hostile takeover.

Almost. Because every sane corporation must have insurance against ransomware if they want to remain on the stock market. Insurance makes good money on ransomware insurance. Ransomware insurance wouldn't be necessary if there wasn't companies performing *corporate network penetrative testing*. Insurance companies have invested heavily in legislation to ensure the viability of ransomware insurance products.

"Okay. Yes," Do-Ye0n agrees. He's already struggling with reputation issues. How much worse can this be?

Moving from level one to level four housing is not how it is usually done. Level one to level two. Years later, level two to level three. Many more years to level four. Do-Ye0n would spend an hour a day just walking from the kitchen to the spacious bedroom if he hadn't already lived in level five. Instead, he sips strong coffee, turns off the mirror health diagnostics, and leaves his bed unmade.

He doesn't work at home. This job requires serious bandwidth and there are legal concerns to be watched carefully. So Do-Ye0n has a desk in a warehouse of desks. The internet flows through the office like an invisible river at flood plain. It feeds whirlpools of data to the fifty-seven people on the inside of a Faraday cage. None of the data leaks out of the office, but those fifty-seven find novel ways to bring data in.

*Corporate network penetrative testing* used to be illegal. It was breaking and entering secured computers. It was against the law. But laws change. People like Do-Ye0n perform a service by identifying companies with sloppy security. It's better to be called out by friends than to be destroyed by enemies.

Teaching a computer to assault a data warehouse is easy. The steps are: gather data, define the goal, try a solution, evaluate success. Do-Ye0n is good at this. He taught cars to solve the trolley problem. He is teaching computers to pick a lock and crack a safe.

Do-Ye0n stares at a matrix of numbers, then switches to a heat map, converting numbers to colors. It looks like a topographic map of Mars. There are rings of blue, then rings of purple, then a circle of red. Red is an opening to a data warehouse and Do-Ye0n grabs it. He encrypts the data then calls his the new client.

"Hello. I'm a cybersecurity analyst with Alpha60," starts Do-Ye0n. "I've identified an opening on your system and performed the encryption necessary to verify our research. Our consulting fee is... (this is where Do-Ye0n inserts a large financial amount in the currency local to the company he contacted.) When you remit that fee we will release both the method of penetration and the encryption key."

"Dammit," says the corporate IT representative Do-Ye0n is talking to. "I thought I had that plugged. Okay, can you send an invoice?"

"I'll have our billing department contact your purchasing agent," says Do-Ye0n. "I see this isn't our first contract, so we already have the necessary information."

"Yep - not our first time," responds IT. "You're going to get me fired if you keep this up."

"You're going to get yourself fired if you don't close these ports," responds Do-Ye0n. "I'll look forward to speaking to you again."

"Asshole," says IT.

"A pleasure," says Do-Ye0n. He breaks the connection.

Do-Ye0n is good at this. He's already in the top ten performers list. If he can keep this momentum, he'll be an associate within a year. Possibly a partner in five.

D0-Ye0n smiles to himself in cubicle number thirty-five of fifty-seven. He takes a moment to savor this unexpected success, but only a moment before he dives into the next corporate network.

Volume 2

Do-Ye0n lives on

1)  \>\>\> publicly traded ransomware companies
2)  arrests based on profitability
3)  bail as recruitment tactic
4)  betting (short and long) on results of conviction
5)  incarceration by public companies
6)  early release based on job interview and desirability of candidate (prisoner)

Do-Ye0n Kurrat is a penetrative tester in automotive ai security.

Companies hire p.testers to ward off ransom ware. But they also use that tech to spy on other companies - intl and domestic. Which is hard to tell the difference.

Sometimes companies run afoul of politicians. Political slogan : "Screw Them!"

Scapegoats are sacrificed (dyk!). I.e. engineers that designed Volkswagen diesel algorithm.

Prosecution of corporate illegal behavior is a competitive strategy. "If you can't beat them, then jail them." Find a way to lock up strategic employees.

"Our assets walk out of the door each evening. We have to make sure that they come back the next morning."

Dyk enters the criminal economy

Question: what does imprisonment look like in 2062?

Purpose of incarceration 1) retribution 2) deterrence 3) rehabilitation 4) incapacitation
