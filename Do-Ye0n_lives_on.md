Nobody sleeps on the streets, but Do-Ye0n fantasizes about it.

Nobody sleeps on the streets since 2052. Housing is a right of citizenship, but level one housing isn't much more than a tent with solid walls and a locking door.

Nobody sleeps on the streets, but if Do-Ye0n wasn't assigned to this apartment, he could choose where he slept. He could choose what he smelled, instead of the odor of chlorine and urine from the cassette toilet. He could choose his neighbors, instead of the screaming and thumping of the genetic cesspool collective living on the other side of the shared wall. He could have his freedom.

But he doesn't. And he's stuck here with just enough internet for what is required of him. Not enough for entertainment; only enough to look for work, pay bills, order food. Until he figures out better employment, he's living here.

He needs to urinate. He climbs out of the bed and takes two steps to the bathroom door. He slides it to the side and considers the sink, toilet, mirror and hand shower. He sits because there isn't room to stand. From his throne, he reaches for the shower head; it doubles as a bidet. Standing, he looks in the mirror.

The mirror tells him about him. Numbers scroll down the left side; blood pressure, possible diabetes, cancer screening, heart attack, addictions, pregnancy (omitted because he's not and never will be). The mirror scans him for melanoma, wounds, and visible signs of stress. It checks his eyesight and retinas for glaucoma or cataracts. Preventative healthcare is cheaper than treatment and everyone in level one housing has a mirror feeding health data to a central diagnostic. No choice about it. Privacy is forfeit.

Do-Ye0n shakes himself, steps out and closes the door. By default, he is now facing the food storage unit (refrigerator, FSU, or "green room" because of the green refrigerant gel). Do-Ye0n reaches into the FSU and pulls out a breakfast provided to level one housing. It's a kind of oatmeal with a packet of banana. Do-Ye0n knows this because it's printed on the package. Without the label it would be difficult to identify. He puts it in the food processor and turns back to the refrigerator to find coffee.

Coffee is optional. He can eat anything he wants, but if it's not level one, he has to buy it himself. And cook it. Which isn't hard; the food processor knows how, just turn it on. But he doesn't have any coffee this morning.

The food processor tells him the thing he placed inside it has been transmogrified into oatmeal. And bananas. Probably.

This apartment doesn't have a proper table. Instead, a panel and chair fold out from the wall. Do-Ye0n can eat breakfast at the table, then clear the packaging, then work, then move the terminal, then eat lunch at the table, then clear the packaging, then...and so on.

If he folds up the bed he has room to briefly pace the apartment. Before he folds out the bed, he has to fold up the table and chair. Before he opens the door, he has to fold up the bed. He doesn't bother, there's nothing outside for him.

//#

Do-Ye0n ranks at 95% proficiency in vehicle AI engineering. Prior to his *almost* conviction he had a level five apartment with a kitchen, living room, bedroom, and a door that could be opened without folding anything in the apartment. He had a window. He was at the top of the industry. He's known in the industry.

He's shunned by the industry.

His resulting unemployment dropped him back to level one. He knows how far he fell and he wants it back.

Today, he has no choice but to open the first job offer of the day. It's a contract gig, just like every other from the past four months. It requires advanced skills but offers minimum payout. This is what he gets after hijacking autonomous vehicles and probably (*not proven or convicted*) killing two people. He accepts and completes the project in two short hours, fulfilling his daily contribution requirement. But that payment doesn't get him out of this apartment.

If he can find long term work, he can move someplace that doesn't stink. Day gigs are a gerbil-wheel for losers. He calls up the job search counselor - an artificial coach with a cheery attitude.

"Do-Ye0n," says the coach. His name tag says *Alex* in a comic-book font. Alex has a head, torso, and arms although he rarely uses anything other than facial expressions. Mostly his eyebrows. Alex is not an expensive render - public funds are better spent on other things. Oatmeal and bananas, for example.

"Welcome back!" Alex is enthusiastic and upbeat. His personality is also not expensive. "I don't have anything for your current profile. Would you like some suggestions?"

"Yes. No. How about broaden the industries you are searching. In fact, please remove the automotive sector entirely. It's obvious they don't want me, so let's move on."

"Done," says Alex without hesitation. "Removing the automotive search restriction produces two good matches; cyber security and agriculture. Which would you like to start with?"

"Which pays better?"

"Cyber security. It is corporate network penetrative testing."

"Ransomware, you mean." Do-Ye0n frowns. "What are the numbers?"

"Ransomware is a diminutive term and not an approved descriptor. Corporate network penetrative testing is ranked in the top 30% of compensation plans, includes level four housing and grants stock options every quarter." Alex smiles. It's the only expression Alex has. "The company is named Alpha60 and they have reviewed your resume. They are extending an offer. Shall I tell them you are able to start?"

"Wait a minute," says Do-Ye0n. He needs time to think. Ransomware professionals are well paid, but accepting a job like this can be a permanent career choice. Once you begin performing *corporate network penetrative testing* all future potential employers view you as a possible threat, maybe even a sleeper for a competitor. That's why compensation and stock options are big.

Not surprisingly, the stock market isn't bothered about this enterprise. Corporate espionage (*ransomware*) has cash flow and can be publicly traded. There are legal issues and occasionally a corporation will step beyond the boundaries, but in those cases, lawsuits are filed, a few guilty engineers are punished, divisions are sold off to competitors and the stockholders lose their investment. Just another hostile takeover.

It's actually a bit more complex. Every sane corporation must have insurance against ransomware if they want to remain on the stock market. No insurance is corporate malfeasance. Insurance makes good money on ransomware insurance. Ransomware insurance wouldn't be necessary if there wasn't companies performing *corporate network penetrative testing*. Insurance companies have invested heavily in legislation to ensure the viability of ransomware insurance products.

"Okay. Yes," Do-Ye0n agrees. He's already struggling with reputation issues. How much worse can this be?

Moving from level one to level four housing isn't normal. First, level one to level two. Years later, level two to level three. Many more years to level four. But today he sips strong coffee, turns off the mirror health diagnostics, and leaves his bed unmade.

He doesn't work at home. This job requires serious bandwidth and there are legal concerns. So Do-Ye0n has a desk in a warehouse of desks. The internet flows through the office like an invisible river at flood plain. It feeds whirlpools of data to the fifty-seven people on the inside of a Faraday cage. None of the data leaks out of the office, but those fifty-seven find novel ways to bring data in.

The internet doesn't have a smell. The men and women connected to it smell. The room could use more ventilation and the people could use a shower; most of them are level three housing and subject to water rationing. There are enough level four employees scattered about the room to keep the level three's envious and motivated. Nobody wants to smell bad. Nobody wants to admit they had oatmeal for breakfast. Level four gets *bacon.*

*Corporate network penetrative testing* used to be illegal. It was breaking and entering secured computers. It was against the law. But laws change. People like Do-Ye0n perform a service by identifying companies with sloppy security. It's better to be called out by friends than to be destroyed by enemies.

Teaching a computer to assault a data warehouse is easy. The steps are: gather data, define the goal, try a solution, evaluate success. Do-Ye0n is good at this. He taught cars to solve the trolley problem. He is teaching computers to pick a lock and crack a safe.

Do-Ye0n stares at a twitching matrix of numbers, then switches to a heat map, converting numbers to colors. It looks like a topographic map of Mars. There are rings of blue, then rings of purple, then a circle of red. Red is an opening to a data warehouse and Do-Ye0n grabs it. He encrypts the data then calls his new client.

"Hello. I'm a cybersecurity analyst with Alpha60," says Do-Ye0n. "I've identified an opening on your system and performed the encryption necessary to verify our research. Our consulting fee is... (this is where Do-Ye0n inserts a large financial amount in the currency local to the company he contacted.) When you remit payment we will release both the method of penetration and the encryption key."

"Dammit," says the corporate IT representative Do-Ye0n is talking to. "I thought I had that plugged, but guess not. Okay, can you send an invoice?"

"I'll have our billing department contact your purchasing agent," says Do-Ye0n. "I see this isn't our first contract, so we already have the necessary information."

"Yep - not our first time," responds IT. "You're going to get me fired if you keep this up."

"You're going to get yourself fired if you don't close these ports," responds Do-Ye0n. "I'll look forward to speaking to you again."

"Asshole," says IT.

"A pleasure," says Do-Ye0n. "Let's do this again soon."

He breaks the connection. He's only been at this for a few months and is already in the top ten performers list. If he can keep this momentum, he'll be an associate within a year. Possibly a partner in five.

D0-Ye0n smiles to himself in cubicle thirty-five of fifty-seven. He takes a moment to savor this unexpected success, but only a moment before he dives into the next corporate network.

"Alpha60 is outperforming."

Chip Venetian tweaks the color of his tie and looks around the virtual conference. Commodities lawyers choose conservative avatars for these meetings, although Chip knows several who will switch out to wild-side versions during their off-hours. While they discuss the business of the partnership, everyone is dead serious.

"They've been hiring penetrators for the past year and are seeing some solid returns. They've documented fifty-seven assets in Portland alone, with probably double that number in New York," says Chip. He tosses an animated performance chart into the room, illustrating the short term growth of Alpha60's value.

"Their stock is valuable enough, and fragile enough, that they'll take an arrest-threat seriously. I think we should realize the value of a strike."

The three non-english speakers respond through translators by presenting icons or changing their expressions. They all agree with Chip. Five of the remaining eight participants verbally agree; three do not. The disagreement isn't about the ethics of Alpha60, or the ethics of threatening a corporation. It's purely about the return on the work to be done to shake-down a business involved in *Corporate Penetrative Testing*. Threatening Alpha60 without preparation would only invite a ransomware attack.

"It's decided then," concludes Chip. "I'll put together a strike team and we can move when the plan is set up. I forecast payoff within the month."

Do-Ye0n swallows the last of a power drink, basketball-tosses the foil container in the trash and waves through the research in his virtual field-of-view. He's already completed one billable invasion this week and he wants the next one to be bigger. Bigger and more worthwhile of his time. If he's going to make partner, he needs impressive plays. He's confident he can swing it.

The shifting graph in his main view is abruptly pushed to the corner. In its place is some sort of corporate communiqué, telling him to please report to room 1233, an office upstairs.

*That was quick*, he thinks. Smiling, he grabs his terminal and heads for the elevator. Working in the cube farm was beneath him and he's looking forward to a room with a view of the skyline.

He presents himself to the elevator station. Almost immediately, one of the sliding doors open and calls his name. He walks in, the door shuts, and accelerates skyward. *This is almost poetic*, he thinks. The interior is bland, but his visor displays enough interesting data to keep his attention. It's only a minute before he's decelerating and stopping on the twelfth floor.

The door opens to an unfinished space. There isn't carpet on the floor, the walls are still rough construction board, and there is no common space. His visor informs him to go left, then straight, then open the third door. *This must be an expansion. I'm on a new team. Probably the director of the team.*

He opens the door marked 1233 and steps in. Two security guards flank a chair, which faces a desk, behind which is sitting a woman younger than Do-Ye0n. Other than the desk and chair, there is no other furniture. There isn't a window and light seems to come from a hidden source. Probably the walls are painted with electro-luminescent paint. One of the security guards moves the chair around, motioning for him to sit. He does so, arranges his legs and faces the woman. He smiles.

"Do-Ye0n Kurrat?" asks the woman. "This is you, correct?"

"Of course," says Do-Ye0n. "I'm pleased to be here."

"Well, maybe not," she responds.

Do-Ye0n notices there is no name band, either real or virtual. Neither guard has a name band. He's the only person with a name in this office.

"I'm afraid we've been notified of some aggressive transactions between you and several corporations." She waves up a list of Do-Ye0n's billable hours over the past month. "You've been planting ransomware in computer systems and extorting companies to have it removed. You've been doing this during work hours and while accessing the corporate bandwidth."

"Yes, I have." agrees Do-Ye0n. "I believe I've been quite successful. Are you saying I haven't been performing to expectations?"

"No," she responds. "I'm saying you're doing illegal things and Alpha60 can't be seen as hosting those activities. We're under investigation for illegal corporate penetrations, of which a majority are from you. I'm saying you're being arrested for felony espionage. These gentlemen will escort you out of the building and to a detention facility.

Do-Ye0n looks at the two security guards and realizes these aren't security guards - they are police. One of them is presenting him with zip-tie handcuffs. The other is helping him to his feet, using gentle restraining force, and turning him around so the officer with the handcuffs can clamp his wrists behind his back.

//#

The back seat of this police transport could be padded, but Do-Ye0n appreciates it should to be easy to clean. Cushions would be absorbent and saturated with pee and vomit. Without cushions, everything is visible and sanitary.

It's a short ride to the station and a shorter trip through booking. He doesn't have pockets so he doesn't have to empty them. His visor is placed in a lock box and secured with a scan of his retina. It's safe until later.

The door opens into a small hall, reminiscent of Alpha60's elevator lobby. One door is open, the other five are closed. It's obvious where he is to go. The room is empty, the wall is a display large enough to show a life-size woman. She might be artificial; Do-Ye0n doesn't care.

"Hello Do-Ye0n. I'm Yvette and I'll be your case manager." She smiles but otherwise avoids the gestures used to reassure humans. "Standardized sentencing dictates bail for your situation at 20% of your current salary plus benefits. Do you already have a chosen bail supplier?"

"Bail supplier?" asks Do-Ye0n. "Forgive me, but things must have changed since I was last arrested. What is a chosen bail supplier?"

"You may already have an employment agreement with first option to supply bail," she says. "Or you may wish to make yourself available to the open market. There are already five corporations ready to provide you with an offer."

"There are corporations competing to provide me with bail?"

"Yes," she says. "Would you like to speak with them? I can sort them by whatever attribute you wish."

Do-Ye0n mulls this over. "What sectors are these corporations operating in?"

"They all specialize in Corporate network penetrative testing."

*Of course,* thinks Do-Ye0n. "Let me speak with the company with the highest market value."

Yvette fades out and is immediately replaced with a different woman, this time dressed in a business sari and an identifier band across the screen. It reads; ***Aishwarya Vala**, Corporate Recruiter, Fairwell Network Security*.

"Hello Do-Ye0n," says Aishwarya. She smiles before she continues with her pitch. "Fairwell would like to supply bail and legal representation for your charges and court appearance. In exchange, we ask for a first employment option after your sentencing and possible incarceration. We request a minimum of five years employment but do not require a non-compete agreement after that time. We offer a level four employment compensation package."

"Yvette?" calls Do-Ye0n. Aishwarya is swapped out of view and Yvette appears in her place. "Are the other offers comparable?"

"Comparable but with minor deviations. This is a standard offer." Yvette says.

"Please bring Aishwarya back," says Do-Yeon. Aishwarya reappears immediately.

"I'll accept your offer," Do-Ye0n tells her. "When does this happen?"

"Most excellent," Aishwarya responds. "Wait just a minute please."

She picks up a tablet, makes a few motions, then returns her attention to Do-Ye0n. "All set. We'll send a car to bring you to our offices. Congratulations on joining up with Fairwell!"

//#

Do-Ye0n meets Aishwarya at the Fairwell corporate headquarters for paperwork and a tour. The first floor is dominated by an opulent reception lobby. Second floor is human resources. Third through fifth floor is the cubicle farm for entry-level employees. Sixth and seventh is private offices for level three employees. Eighth and ninth is level four. They don't tour floors above nine; those require a separate elevator and Aishwarya doesn't have permission to use it.

Do-Ye0n is assigned an office on ninth floor. There is a window and he can see the wires of the radiation cage embedded in the glass. *What happens on ninth floor stays on ninth floor.*

"Welcome to your new home," says Aishwarya. "Is there anything else I can do to make your transition pleasant?"

"Aren't you moving a bit fast?" asks Do-Ye0n. "I still have a court appearance. Hopefully things go well. But what if they don't?"

"We ran your odds before we made the offer," she says. "You're a lock - there's barely a chance you'll be convicted. Be sure to watch the futures on your conviction when you're not reading Fairwell stock values."

"I guess I'm new to this world," he says. "I used to worry about breaking the law. It seems like you consider it part of the job."

"Nobody here will agree with that statement," she says. "We strive to provide the highest level of service to our clients. Sometimes they don't realize how much service they need."

"I still have questions," he says. "But I haven't eaten. Is there any chance we can continue this orientation over dinner?"

Aishwarya pauses and considers Do-Ye0n. "Sure, but I have to buy. I can't accept gifts from new hires."

//#

"Get up," Aishwarya says. "We need to get into the office. I've got recruitment quotas that won't be satisfied hanging out here. And as I recall, you have a meeting with your lawyer, Steve. Miss it and you're going to fade into an underdog in the betting pool."

Do-Ye0n puts a pillow over his head, but Aishwarya pulls it away and throws it to the corner of the room. "Nobody cares if I'm convicted," he says. "I'm not going to serve time, Fairwell is going to pay the settlement, my lawyer gets paid either way."

"I care," says Aishwarya. "I've got action on you. Don't blow up my investment."

Do-Ye0n sits up. "You bet on my innocence?"

"No. I bet on the probability your case will be dismissed. The stats department at Fairwell is confident you're a favorable risk. I'm just following their bet."

"So romantic." He flops back on the bed, covering his head with the sheet. "Are we sleeping here tonight or at your place?"

"We've had this conversation for five months now," Aishwarya says. She climbs across the bed and touches his forehead. "Maybe we should think about a longer-term solution?"

//#

Do-Ye0n is wears a formal shirt. And formal pants. Court appearances are still in person and defendants have to stand up. There is no hiding behind a desk.

"Do-Ye0n Kurrat, case 63-CR-325631. Please step forward."

The prior defendant was not guilty and happily leaves the room by the door behind the seated observers. The other door, next to the baliff, is for unhappy defendants.

Do-Ye0n steps up next to Steve, a real (not virtual) lawyer supplied by Fairwell. They've been working on his case for several months but with the assumption this will be nothing more than a reading of charges followed by a dismissal. At worst, he'll agree to a plea bargain with probation.

Also stepping forward is the prosecuting attorney. Do-Ye0n's lawyer does a literal double-take. "Jim-bo. Are you defense?" There is a note of surprise in this friendly greeting. Maybe a note of concern.

"Hi Steve," says Attorney Jim Lancaster, aka *Jim-bo*. One of Portland's highest paid lawyers.

There's no time for conversation, but both attorneys straighten up. Do-Ye0n must have caught someone's attention, or his case caught someone's attention, or the nature of *Corporate Penetrative Testing* caught someone's attention.

Do-Ye0n hears his lawyer quietly swear. He uneasily looks at the door behind the baliff.

//#

"Three years?" screams Do-Ye0n. "This was supposed to be a sure thing. I'm supposed to be in a meeting this afternoon. I'm having dinner with Aishwarya tonight."

Do-Ye0n faces his lawyer across the table in the room behind the door behind the baliff. Do-Ye0n is just as surprised as Steve to hear he will be doing time. Justice used to move slower. Court appearance and sentencing used to take days, sometimes weeks. Now it takes hours. Do-Ye0n is returning to serve his time so much sooner than he expected.

"Okay. This didn't go the way we planned," admits Steve, his now disgraced lawyer. "But I wouldn't worry. Fairview has an interest in your employment after incarceration. It's in their best interests for you to get out quickly, and I expect they'll be calling tomorrow morning to get me started on your early release."

"Which sounds like I'll be spending tonight in prison," says Do-Ye0n. He was not exhibiting self-control. "I'm not okay with this!"

"Relax. We'll get this under control," says Steve. "Take the night off. Think of this as a ....
