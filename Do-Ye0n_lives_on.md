Nobody sleeps on the streets, but Do-Ye0n fantasizes about it.

Housing is a right of citizenship since 2052. The level one housing Do-Ye0n is assigned to is just solid walls and a locking door. Nothing more. The community bathrooms are cleaned every hour, but the floors still host a persistent culture of bacteria. It's best to wear shoes and disinfect when you get home.

If housing wasn't enforced, he could choose where he slept. He could choose what he smelled, instead of the odor of chlorine and urine from the sanitizers. He could choose his neighbors, instead of the screaming and thumping of the genetic cesspool collective living on the other side of the shared wall. He could have his freedom.

If you kneel, close your eyes, straighten your back, and tilt your head upwards you appear content. Do-Ye0n has his eyes closed, but sits on the bed with shoulders slumped, head down. This is the posture of defeat.

He should have made better choices at his last job. Maybe he shouldn't have used a debug tool on those self-driving cars. Maybe he shouldn't have driven them off the road. Maybe he killed the drivers. None of it was proven. But things didn't go his way and he's stuck here with minimal internet. Not enough for entertainment; only enough to look for work, pay bills, order food. Until he figures out better employment, he's languishing here.

He could move back in with his parents. Sell everything, pack a bag, book a poverty ticket on a boat, suffer through seasickness for a week, return to his childhood room and try to restart his life.

He rises and spits on the floor. Something will clean it up. He puts on his visor and walks down the hall to the bathroom.

The floor is covered with a realtor-beige colored absorptive layer; spills and drips seep through capillary drains. To his left, a woman exits one of the five private stalls, glares at Do-Ye0n, and turns to the mirror to pick at her teeth. The stall closes and cleans itself with a blast of chlorinated steam, then opens, ready for the next customer. He enters and sits.

It features a throne and hand-shower doubling as a bidet. He urinates and numbers scroll down the left side of his visor; blood pressure, possible diabetes, cancer screening, heart attack, addictions, pregnancy (omitted from display: he doesn't have a uterus). Invasive cameras scan him for melanoma, wounds, and visible signs of stress. They check his eyesight and retinas for glaucoma or cataracts. Preventative healthcare is cheaper than treatment and everyone in level one housing has their health data collected. No choice about it. Privacy is a privilege.

Do-Ye0n returns to his housing box and disinfects his feet, carefully spraying between his toes. He reminds himself to wear shoes next time. The spittle on the floor is gone, consumed by a sanitizer robot entering from the small door in the wall near the floorboard. He suspects it spreads disease from room to room.

He stands, facing the food storage unit (refrigerator, FSU, or "green room" because of the green refrigerant gel). Do-Ye0n reaches into the FSU and pulls out a breakfast provided to level one housing. It's a kind of oatmeal with a packet of banana. Do-Ye0n knows this because it's printed on the package. Without the label it would be difficult to identify. He puts it in the food processor and turns back to the refrigerator to find coffee.

But coffee isn't level one. He can eat anything he wants, but if it's not level one, he has to buy it himself. And cook it. Which isn't hard; the food processor knows how, just turn it on. But he doesn't have any coffee this morning.

The food processor tells him the thing he placed inside has changed into oatmeal. And bananas. Probably. It *almost* smells like oatmeal, but he knows what oatmeal really smells like. He got it when he lived in level five. This oatmeal has a faint odor of warm plastic. The banana bits are chewy, like banana-flavored apple bits..

This apartment doesn't have a proper table. Instead, a panel and chair fold out from the wall. Do-Ye0n can eat breakfast at the table, then clear the food packaging, then work, then move the terminal, then eat lunch at the table, then clear the packaging, then...and so on.

If he folds up the bed he has room to briefly pace the apartment. Before he folds out the bed, he has to fold up the table and chair. Before he opens the door, he has to fold up the bed. He doesn't bother, there's nothing outside for him. He slumps to sitting on the bed. His eyes are closed, his head is down.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do-Ye0n ranks at 95% proficiency in vehicle AI engineering. Prior to his *almost* conviction he had a level five apartment with a kitchen, living room, bedroom, and a door that could be opened without folding anything in the apartment. He had a window. He was at the top of the industry. He's known in the industry.

He's shunned by the industry.

His resulting unemployment dropped him back to level one. He knows how far he fell and he wants it back. But first, he has a work quota to fill. He clears the table of the half-eaten pseudo-oatmeal.

He has no choice but to open the first job offer of the day. It's a contract gig, just like every other from the past four months. It requires advanced skills but offers minimum payout. This is what he gets after hijacking autonomous vehicles and probably (*not proven or convicted*) killing two people. He accepts and completes the project in two short hours.

A second short-term gig slides into view, marked as \#*IntlPenTest*. International Penetration Testing, also known as short-term freelance espionage against some country - or someone pretending to be a country. It's an easy ask, just annoy the target long enough to get their attention. Not much different than yelling "*Hey - stop that*" when you see a thief stealing a bicycle. One *HeyStopThat* isn't going to change anything; one-hundred *HeyStopThat*s might cause them to reconsider. Do-Ye0n takes the gig, harasses someone for forty-eight minutes, then collects his fee.

Do-Ye0n thinks of going out for the afternoon. Possibly taking his lunch to the park, sitting on a bench, watching people enjoying themselves. There would be clusters of parents talking while their kids and dogs play. There might be other singles eating their lunches, also looking for companionship.

He reflects on the difficulty of friendships. Friends take time, they always want something or they want him to do something. Girlfriends, especially, are a lot of work. His past attempts were unsatisfying. A match would appear. He would respond, tentatively. A few times they would send something back. They would want him to do something.

If he can find long term work, he can move someplace that doesn't stink. Day gigs are a gerbil-wheel for losers. He calls up the job search counselor - an artificial coach with a cheery attitude.

"*Helllll-oooo* Do-Ye0n," says the coach. His name tag says *Alex* in a comic-book font. Alex has a head, torso, and arms although he rarely uses anything other than facial expressions. Mostly his eyebrows. Alex is not an expensive render - public funds are better spent on other things. Oatmeal and bananas, for example.

"Welcome back!" Alex is enthusiastic and upbeat. His personality, like his appearance, is not expensive. "I don't have anything for your current profile. Would you like some suggestions?"

"Yes. No. How about broaden the industries you are searching. In fact, please remove the automotive sector entirely. It's obvious they don't want me, so let's move on."

"Done," says Alex without hesitation. "Removing the automotive search restriction produces two good matches; cyber security and agriculture. Which would you like to start with?"

"What is the agriculture gig?"

"Training field robots to recognize and exterminate an invasive worm. Agricultural work is socially rewarding and employees working in this sector report a high degree of job satisfaction and self worth."

"Which job pays better?"

"Cyber security. It is corporate network penetrative testing. They have already referenced the #IntlPenTest job you just completed and gave your solution a five-star review. They want you to do more."

"Corporate network penetrative testing is just a fancy name for ransomware," Do-Ye0n frowns. "What are the numbers?"

"Ransomware is a diminutive term and not an approved descriptor. Corporate network penetrative testing is ranked in the top 30% of compensation plans, includes level three housing and grants stock options every quarter." Alex smiles. It's the only expression Alex has. "The company is named Alpha60. They are extending an offer. Shall I tell them you are able to start?"

"Wait a minute," says Do-Ye0n. He needs time to think. Ransomware professionals are well paid, but accepting a job like this can be a permanent career choice. Once you add *corporate network penetrative testing* to your resume future potential employers view you as a possible threat, maybe even a sleeper for a competitor. This explains why compensation and stock options are big.

Not surprisingly, the stock market isn't bothered about this enterprise. Corporate espionage (*ransomware*) has good cash flow and can be publicly traded. There *are* legal issues and occasionally a corporation will step beyond the boundaries, but in those cases, lawsuits are filed, a few guilty engineers are punished, divisions are sold off to competitors and the stockholders lose their investment. Just another hostile takeover.

It's actually a bit more complex. Every sane corporation must have insurance against ransomware if they want to remain on the stock market. Not carrying insurance is corporate malfeasance. The insurance industry makes good money on *corporate penetrative network testing* insurance and they invested in legislation to ensure the viability of ransomware insurance products.

The world isn't done with ethics. Not yet. He could explain the agriculture job to his parents. He could go to parties and not have to debate his career choices. He could go on a date and discuss his occupation with pride instead of evasion. Killing invasive worms would be the right thing to do.

"I'll take the job from Alpha60," Do-Ye0n says. He's already struggling with reputation issues. How much worse can this be? And the pay is better.

He straightens his back. Just a bit.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moving from level one to level three housing isn't the normal progression. Normal is level one to level two. Years later, level two to level three. But today he sips strong coffee, turns off the mirror health diagnostics, and leaves his bed unmade.

Leaving his apartment had been easy.

1.  Pack his shit in one biodegradable bag.

2.  Walk two blocks to the new place.

3.  Open a new door, walk in, toss the bag in the closet.

He clasps his hands behind his back and looks out his new window at the sunny day. There is a tree cresting over the apartment building across the street. Maybe there is a park nearby.

The bathroom (*he has a private bathroom*) doesn't stink of urine or bleach; just a faint orange scent. His window (a *window!*) displays the Willamette river. The ferries to Vancouver and Astoria leave for the second trip of the day.

But he cannot gloat for long. The job at Alpha60 requires serious bandwidth and there are legal concerns about who is contacting who and why, so he has to commute to an office. Do-Ye0n locks the door behind him and strolls to the subway, smiling at the neighbors, reading his news feed.

Do-Ye0n has a desk in a warehouse of desks. The internet flows through the office like an invisible river at flood plain. It feeds whirlpools of data to the fifty-seven people on the inside of a Faraday cage. None of the data leaks out of the office, but those fifty-seven find profitable ways to bring data in.

The internet doesn't have a smell, unlike the men and women connected to it. The room could use more ventilation and these people could use a shower; most of them are level two housing and subject to water rationing. There are enough level three employees scattered about the room to keep the level two's envious and motivated. Nobody wants to smell bad. Nobody wants to admit they had oatmeal for breakfast. Level three gets *bacon.*

*Corporate network penetrative testing* used to be illegal. It is breaking and entering secured computers. It was against the law. But laws change. People like Do-Ye0n perform a service by identifying companies with sloppy security. It's better to be called out by friends than to be destroyed by enemies.

Teaching a computer to assault a data warehouse is easy. The steps are well known: gather data, try a solution, evaluate success. Just like the rules of tennis; see the ball, hit the ball. But performing a task competently isn't as easy as knowing the rules and Do-Ye0n is good at this. He teaches computers to pick a lock and crack a safe.

Do-Ye0n stares at a twitching matrix of numbers, then switches to a heat map, converting numbers to colors. It looks like a topographic map of Mars. There are rings of blue, then rings of purple, then a small circle of red. Red is the unprotected opening to a corporate data warehouse used by a retailer of hemolytic filters. Do-Ye0n encrypts the data in the warehouse then calls his new client.

"Hello. I'm a cybersecurity analyst with Alpha60," says Do-Ye0n. "I've identified an opening on your system and performed the encryption necessary to verify our research. Our consulting fee is... (this is where Do-Ye0n inserts a large financial amount in the currency local to the company he contacted.) When you remit payment we will release both the method of penetration and the encryption key."

"Dammit," says the corporate IT representative Do-Ye0n is talking to. "I thought I had that plugged, but guess not. Okay, can you send an invoice?"

"Let me put you through to our billing department," says Do-Ye0n. "I see we've done business before."

"Yep - not our first time," responds IT. "You're going to get me fired if you keep this up."

"You're going to get yourself fired if you don't close these ports," responds Do-Ye0n. "I'll look forward to speaking to you again."

"Asshole," says IT.

"A pleasure," says Do-Ye0n. "Let's do this again soon."

He forwards the connection to billing. He's only been at this for a few months and is already in the top ten performers list. If he can keep this momentum, he'll be an associate within a year. Possibly a partner in five. He imagines a privileged life, possibly with a girlfriend, social engagements, and invitations to parties.

Do-Ye0n smiles to himself in cubicle thirty-five of fifty-seven. He takes a moment to savor this unexpected success, then dives into the next unprotected corporation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Alpha60 is outperforming."

Chip Venetian tweaks the color of his tie and looks around the virtual conference of five partners. Commodities lawyers choose conservative avatars for these meetings, although Chip knows several who will switch to wild-side versions during their off-hours. For now, while they discuss the business of the partnership, everyone is dead serious.

"They've been hiring penetrators for the past year and are seeing some solid returns. Their annual report documented fifty-seven assets in Portland alone, with probably double that number in New York," says Chip. He tosses an animated performance chart into the room, illustrating the short term growth of Alpha60's value.

"Fairwell Network Security has approached us with a contract to oversee a strategic incarceration on Alpha60. *If you can't beat them, jail them.* Fairwell wants us to lock up a few Alpha60 employees long enough to give Fairwell a competitive advantage."

"Alpha60 stock is fragile and valuable. They'll take an arrest-threat seriously. I think we should realize the value of a strike."

"The ethics of this make me nervous," says the oldest partner. "I recognize I'm operating on traditional rules, but this has bad karma and the consequences are painful."

"Your traditional rules are based on traditional models," replies the outside partner. "We're not operating in those models anymore, so breaking old rules doesn't imply the same consequences."

"Ethics are bullshit," says a bearded partner. "Rules are made by technocrats to keep themselves in power. If we follow them, they are stronger and we never succeed."

"Oh please," says the partner with the highest bandwidth. "Let's save the ethics discussion for the bar. We're here purely to decide on the financial return of a shake-down of a business involved in *Corporate Penetrative Testing*. Do we make money or not?"

"True," says the last partner. "Threatening Alpha60 without preparation would only invite a ransomware attack. That's a negative return. We simply check our defense then take them down."

"If the only objections are ethical, It's decided," concludes Chip. "I'll put together a strike team and we can move when the plan is set up. I forecast payoff within the month."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do-Ye0n swallows the last of a power drink, basketball-tosses the foil container in the trash and waves through the research in his virtual field-of-view. He's already completed one billable invasion this week and he wants the next one to be bigger. Bigger and more worthwhile of his time. If he's going to make partner, he needs impressive plays. He's confident he can swing it.

The shifting graph in his main view is abruptly pushed to the corner. In its place is some sort of corporate communiqué, telling him to please report to room 1233, an office upstairs.

*That was quick*, he thinks. Smiling, he heads for the elevator. Working in the cube farm was beneath him and he's looking forward to a room with a view of the skyline.

He presents himself to the elevator station. Almost immediately, one of the sliding doors open and calls his name. He walks in, the door shuts, and accelerates skyward. *This is poetic*, he thinks. The interior is bland, but his visor displays enough interesting data to keep him amused. It's only a minute before he decelerates and stops on the twelfth floor.

The door opens to an unfinished space. There isn't carpet on the floor, the walls are still rough construction board. There is a faint smell of paint and glue. His visor informs him to go left, then straight, then open the third door. *This must be an expansion,* he thinks. *I'm on a new team. Probably the director of the team.*

He opens the door marked 1233 and steps in. Two security guards flank a chair which faces a desk, behind which sits a woman younger than Do-Ye0n. Other than the desk and chair, there is no other furniture. There isn't a window and light seems to come from a hidden source. Probably the walls are painted with electro-luminescent paint. One of the security guards moves the chair around, motioning for him to sit. He does so, arranges his legs and faces the woman. He smiles.

"Do-Ye0n Kurrat?" asks the woman. "This is you, correct?"

"Of course," says Do-Ye0n. "I'm pleased to be here."

"Maybe not," she responds.

Do-Ye0n notices there is no name band, either real or virtual. Neither guard has a name band. He's the only person with a name in this office.

"We've been notified of some aggressive transactions between you and several corporations." She waves up a list of Do-Ye0n's billable hours over the past month. "You've been planting ransomware in computer systems and extorting companies to have it removed. You've been doing this during work hours and while accessing the corporate bandwidth."

"Yes, I have." agrees Do-Ye0n. "I believe I've been quite successful. Are you saying I haven't been performing to expectations?"

"No," she responds. "I'm saying you're doing illegal things and Alpha60 can't be seen as hosting those activities. We're under investigation for illegal corporate penetrations, several of which are from you. I'm saying you're being arrested for felony espionage."

"I'm sorry," says Do-Ye0n. "I've been doing what you asked me to do. I found vulnerable data warehouses and pointed it out to the owners of that data. That's what penetrative testing is."

"That's one interpretation," she replies. "But it's an illegal interpretation. Here at Alpha60, we pride ourselves on making the world safe from hackers and other miscreants while maintaining an ethically spotless profile."

"You've seen everything I've been working on," states Do-Ye0n. He leans forward and the two security guards take a step closer. "You've encouraged everything I've done. How can you suddenly tell me I'm unethical?"

"We've determined you were acting alone and without sufficient supervision from your manager. He was fired this morning," she says. "These officers will escort you out of the building and to a detention facility."

Do-Ye0n looks at the security guards and realizes these aren't security guards - they are police. One of them presents him with zip-tie handcuffs. The other helps him to his feet, using gentle restraining force, and turns him around to clamp his wrists behind his back.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The back seat of this police transport could be padded. Despite his agitation, Do-Ye0n appreciates the hard plastic. Cushions would be absorbent and saturated with pee and vomit. Without cushions, everything is visible and sanitary.

It's a short ride to the station and a shorter trip through booking. He doesn't have pockets so he doesn't have to empty them. His visor is placed in a lock box and secured with a scan of his retina. It's safe until later.

He's a bit faint. Maybe it's the power drink wearing off and missing lunch. Maybe it's the missing visor. Or maybe he's fucked and he knows it.

His guard escorts him into a small hall, reminiscent of Alpha60's elevator lobby. One door is open, the other five are closed. It's obvious where he is to go. The room is empty, the wall is a display large enough to show a life-size woman. She might be artificial; Do-Ye0n doesn't care.

"Hello Do-Ye0n. I'm Yvette and I'll be your case manager." She smiles but otherwise avoids the gestures used to reassure humans. "Standardized sentencing dictates bail for your situation at 20% of your current salary plus benefits. Do you already have a chosen supplier?"

"Bail supplier?" asks Do-Ye0n. The faintness hasn't cleared up and he is having problems connecting his thoughts. "Forgive me, but things must have changed since I was last arrested. What is a chosen bail supplier?"

"You may already have an employment agreement with first option to supply bail," she says. "Or you may wish to make yourself available to the open market. There are already five corporations ready to provide you with an offer."

"There are corporations competing to provide me with bail?"

"Yes," she says. "Would you like to speak with them? I can sort them by whatever attribute you wish."

Do-Ye0n mulls this over. "What sectors are these corporations operating in?"

"They all specialize in corporate network penetrative testing."

*Of course,* thinks Do-Ye0n. "Let me speak with the company with the highest market value."

Yvette fades out and is immediately replaced with a different woman, this time dressed in a business saree and an identifier band across the screen. It reads; ***Aishwarya Vala**, Corporate Recruiter, Fairwell Network Security*.

"Hello Do-Ye0n," says Aishwarya. She smiles before she continues with her pitch. "Fairwell would like to supply bail and legal representation for your charges and court appearance. In exchange, we ask for a first employment option after your sentencing and possible incarceration. We request a minimum of five years employment but do not require a non-compete agreement after that time. We offer a level four employment compensation package."

"Yvette?" calls Do-Ye0n. Aishwarya is swapped out of view and Yvette appears in her place. "Are the other offers comparable?"

"Comparable but with minor deviations. This is a standard offer." Yvette says.

"Please bring Aishwarya back," says Do-Ye0n. Aishwarya reappears immediately.

"I'll accept your offer," Do-Ye0n tells her. "When does this happen?"

"Most excellent," Aishwarya responds. "Wait just a minute please."

In full view of Do-Ye0n, she picks up a tablet, makes a few motions, then returns her attention. "All set. We'll send a car to bring you to our offices. Congratulations on joining up with Fairwell!"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The car Do-Ye0n rides in impresses everyone it passes, but it is mostly meant to impress the rider. It's longer by half than other vehicles and emits a low rumble: subsonic, so it is felt rather than heard. Blue-green waves of light pulse from front to back, like a ocean heartbeat. Inside, the seats are held at a constant body temperature. The in-dash bartender asks Do-Ye0n what type of Scotch he desires.

The car slides into its privileged space at Fairwell and opens, urging Do-Ye0n to step out. Aishwarya is already waiting for him. Do-Ye0n notices she is still wearing the business saree, but without the formal jacket. Her eyes seem more vibrant than when they conversed earlier that afternoon.

"Namaste," she presses her palms together and touches her forehead, then looks up. "Fairwell is pleased you are here. As am I." She smiles warmly, moves closer and takes his arm. "Can I give you a tour?"

Do-Ye0n is uncertain about this woman's familiarity. Aishwarya is attractive and how he should respond is unfamiliar. He decides to emulate a confident industry player, although his only models come from fictional vidplays. "Yes, please," he replies, dropping his voice to emulate a rich baritone. The emulation is unpracticed and amateurish, but Aishwarya doesn't object.

They enter the first floor lobby, dominated by an opulent reception station. The second floor is occupied by human resources, but Aishwarya bypasses this in favor of the third floor. Third through fifth floor is the cubicle farm for entry-level employees. Sixth and seventh is private offices for level three employees. Eighth and ninth is level four. They don't tour floors above nine; those require a separate elevator and Aishwarya doesn't have permission to use it.

Do-Ye0n is assigned an office on ninth floor. There is a window and he can see the wires of the radiation cage embedded in the glass. *What happens on ninth floor stays on ninth floor.*

"Welcome to your new family," says Aishwarya. She walks to the window, then half-turns to regard him over her shoulder. "I think you're going to be one of my better recruits."

"Isn't this a bit presumptive?" asks Do-Ye0n. He considers Aishwarya for a moment, then continues. "I still have a court appearance. Hopefully things go well. But what if they don't?"

"We ran your odds before we made the offer," she says. "You're a lock - there's barely a chance you'll be convicted. Be sure to watch the futures on your conviction when you're not gloating on Fairwell stock values."

"I guess I'm new to this world," he says. "It seems like you assume breaking the law is part of the job."

"Nobody here will agree with that statement on record," she says, then turns and walks towards him and touches his arm. "Fairwell strives to provide the highest level of service to our clients. Sometimes they don't realize how much service they need."

"I still have questions," he says. "But I haven't eaten. Can we continue this orientation over dinner?"

"I believe I have met my quota for the day, so, yes. Then I'll be able to show you your new apartment. Like they say, nobody sleeps on the streets."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Get up," Aishwarya says, selecting a saree from her closet. "We need to get into the office. I've got recruitment quotas that won't be satisfied hanging out here. And as I recall, you have a meeting with your lawyer. Miss it and you're going to become an underdog in the betting pool."

Do-Ye0n puts a pillow over his head, but Aishwarya pulls it away and throws it to the corner of the room. "Nobody cares if I'm convicted," he says. "I'm not going to serve time, Fairwell is going to pay the settlement, my lawyer gets paid either way."

"I care," says Aishwarya. "I've got action on you. Don't blow up my investment."

Do-Ye0n sits up. "You bet on my innocence?"

"No. I bet on the probability your case will be dismissed. The stats department at Fairwell is confident you're a favorable risk. I'm just following their bet."

"So romantic." He flops back on the bed, covering his head with the sheet. "Are we sleeping here tonight or at my place?"

"We've had this conversation for five months now," Aishwarya says. She climbs across the bed and touches his face. "Maybe we should think about a longer-term solution?"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do-Ye0n is wears a formal shirt. And formal pants. Court appearances are still in person and defendants have to stand up. There is no hiding behind a desk.

"Do-Ye0n Kurrat, case 63-CR-325631. Please step forward."

The prior defendant was not guilty and happily leaves the room by the door behind the seated observers. The other door, next to the bailiff, is for unhappy defendants.

Do-Ye0n steps up next to Steve, a real (not virtual) lawyer supplied by Fairwell. They've been working on his case for several months but with the assumption this will be nothing more than a reading of charges followed by a dismissal. At worst, he'll agree to a plea bargain with probation.

Also stepping forward is the prosecuting attorney. Do-Ye0n's lawyer does a literal double-take. "Jim-bo. Are you prosecution?" There is a note of surprise in this friendly greeting. Maybe a note of concern.

"Hi Steve," says Attorney Jim Lancaster, aka *Jim-bo*. One of Portland's highest paid and most aggressive lawyers.

There's no time for conversation, but both attorneys straighten up. Do-Ye0n must have caught someone's attention, or his case caught someone's attention, or the nature of *Corporate Penetrative Testing* caught someone's attention.

Steve swears quietly. Do-Ye0n looks uneasily at the door behind the bailiff.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Ten years?" screams Do-Ye0n. "This was supposed to be a sure thing. I'm supposed to be in a meeting this afternoon. I'm having dinner with Aishwarya tonight."

Do-Ye0n faces his lawyer across the table in the room behind the door behind the baliff. Do-Ye0n is just as surprised as Steve to hear he will be doing time. Justice used to move slower. Court appearance and sentencing used to take days, sometimes weeks. Now it takes hours.

"Okay. This didn't go the way we planned," admits Steve, his now disgraced lawyer. "But I wouldn't worry much. Fairview has an interest in your employment after incarceration. It's in their best interests for you to get out quickly, and I expect they'll be calling tomorrow morning to get me started on your early release."

"Which sounds like I'll be spending tonight in prison," says Do-Ye0n. He was not exhibiting self-control. "I'm not okay with this!"

"Relax. We'll get this under control," says Steve. "Take the night off. Think of this as a spa day, just without the spa. Let's talk first thing in the morning."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

But Steve doesn't call the next morning. Do-Ye0n hears nothing from anyone until Aishwarya arranges a visit a week later.

"I had to give up our apartment," she says. "Without us together, I'm only allowed a level three single apartment. Plus I lost a lot of money on your conviction. I moved your things into storage, there just isn't room for all of the furniture."

"Fine. Sell the big stuff we bought," Do-Ye0n says. "keep my personal things in your closet. We can move back to a larger place when I get out."

"Don't get this wrong," Aishwarya says. "I think you've got potential, but I need space to think this out. I want to have children. I can't wait ten years for you to be released. Even then you'll need to relearn skills and restart employment. It could be fifteen or sixteen years before we can afford a place big enough for a family."

"You're breaking up with me?" asks Do-Ye0n.

"We need to think about our options. I'll call you next week and we can talk more."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Learning a new habit takes most people three weeks of repeated practice. Adjusting to a new living situation takes a bit longer; some research says a year and a half. For Do-Ye0n, it takes two years to become accustomed to prison habits.

He no longer sticks out as the new guy. He knows when to talk and when shut up. He lines up for meals, fresh clothes and linens. He knows when the commissary is open. He made a friend, that friend was transferred and he learned to make more than one friend. He listens more than talks. He doesn't borrow, doesn't loan.

His state-sponsored accommodations aren't given the dignity of a rating. He thinks of it as level zero. The bathroom is communal, his room is spartan, his privacy is nil. The mirror reads his physical health, but doesn't reveal the results to him. Other inmates will be able to view his stats, and that will violate HIPAA laws. If he wants to know his blood pressure, he will need to file a freedom of information.

He gets depressed. He gets counseling. He gets exercise. He gets outdoors. Most important, he gets jobs.

He is back to small gig jobs, but with close supervision, limited bandwidth, and short working hours. Seventy-five percent of his income is garnished to pay for his incarceration. He's having a difficult time saving anything for retirement or moving into something other than level one housing when he gets out.

He's not happy about this. He didn't do anything wrong, he continues to do nothing wrong. Yvette explained it all to him when he figured out how to ask the right question: *"What is the purpose of this? Why am I here?"*

Yvette is programmed to recite a carefully scripted response. The response is a result of coaching by the Hammurabi corporation, owner of the private incarceration holding Do-Ye0n.

"Incarceration provides society with several benefits," begins Yvette. "First, it provides crime victims with a sense of retribution. Without retribution, victims lose faith in the system of justice. Without retribution, victims resort to vigilantism and other aberrant social behavior."

"I could have viewed this video without your help," retorts Do-Ye0n. "I believe this is covered in some corporate shareholder discussion. I'm guessing Hammurabi? Perhaps Incarceration Corporation of America?"

Yvette pauses for this outburst just like a video playback. At least her mouth closes and she continues to blink and watch Do-Ye0n. But it is clear she is following a playback.

"Second, incarceration is a deterrence to aberrant social behavior," she continues. Do-Ye0n rolls his eyes and sits with resignation. "Law abiding citizens, like all men, are tempted by legal shortcuts to desired results. Without deterrents, there would be no consequences for misbehaving."

From his seat, Do-Ye0n sits up and interrupts. "I wasn't misbehaving. I was doing what Alpha60 rewarded me to do. Why aren't they in here with me?"

"Corporations have rights, just like every other citizen of the United States," replied Yvette, projecting synthesized patience. "Jailing a corporation and all its employees and shareholders is impractical. With a low possibility of success it is a waste of judicial resources."

Do-Ye0n slumps back in the chair. He doesn't miss the subtext; Yvette knows how to respond to questions about corporate culpability. Yvette resumes the lecture.

"Third, incarceration provides an opportunity to rehabilitate offenders. Criminals haven't benefited from the lessons of social cooperation and mutually beneficial behaviors. Without rehabilitation, crime and incarceration are an endless cycle a criminal will never escape."

Do-Ye0n retreats to a futile hand-waving gesture that encourages Yvette to speed up the unwelcome playback. Yvette does not take the hint.

"Finally, incarceration is a short term method for incapacitating a persistent criminal. Many criminals refuse to change past behaviors and are not deterred by incarceration. Without incapacitation, some criminals view release from prison as a short-term window to enhance their aberrant career."

"Your talking points are a polite way of justifying why this corporation needs to keep prisons operating and occupied," spits back Do-Ye0n. "No incarceration, no cash flow. No cash flow, no market value. No market value, no shareholders. If I had been smart, I would have bought stock in Hammurabi before I was sent here. Then I would have at least profited from my unjust imprisonment."

Yvette isn't programmed to disagree. And she doesn't.

Everyday, D0-Ye0n receives a call from Yvette for case management. She is his only caller. But not today.

"Hello Do-Ye0n," says *not* Yvette*.*

"You're not Yvette," Do-Ye0n states the obvious.

"True," says Steve. "Sorry I didn't get back to you sooner. Been busy, all that kind of stuff."

"Sorry?" says Do-Ye0n. "That's all you have? *Sorry?* Where did you go? You said you'd call me the day after my appearance. What happened in there?"

"It was a complex deal," replies Steve. "My office A.I. has been analyzing it for some time. It came up with three hundred and fifty-seven scenarios before it solved what happened. Jimbo didn't even know until I told him last week. We had lunch."

"You had lunch with the guy who's responsible for this?" Do-Ye0n gestured at the prison-surplus terminal he was forced to gig with."

"Yep. And I won't even include it in your billable hours. Here's the deal. You were doing a great job for Alpha60. A *really* great job. Alpha60 was eclipsing the market and Fairwell couldn't compete, so they hired a corporate raider to trip Alpha60 up."

"But Fairwell provided my employment and legal contract!"

"Entirely opportunistic. Fairwell didn't expect Alpha60 to throw you under the bus. When you were available, they swooped in. You do have to admire how quickly they put that package together."

"But they aren't clever enough to keep me out of here."

"Jimbo is a good litigator and you attracted a lot of action. More than I realized. Some big investors and mostly-illegal cartels formed a hedge fund, bought a strong position in your case, and made sure they didn't lose."

"And now?" asks Do-Ye0n. He's not done being sarcastic. "You show up with a social visit. Should I make an appointment with your scheduler for repeat meeting in two years?"

"No need," Steve pulls up a document for Do-Ye0n to see. "This is an early release. It has some contingencies, but nothing you haven't already encountered over the last couple of years. Take a look, but this second document is more interesting."

"Let me see it," says Do-Ye0n. Steve waves the document over to him and it floats across the security barrier. "This is some sort of spreadsheet with my name on it."

"Yep. You're no longer profitable. Hammurabi ran a cost-benefit analysis on your imprisonment. You make too much on your gigs to allow Hammurabi to claim you as a reimbursable burden and collect fees from the state. But you don't make enough to be in the top 20% of income producers for incarceration by Hamurabi. Additionally, they're not impressed by your long-term prospects. You're not profitable and they want to fill your bunk with someone who has a better payoff."

"I'm being fired for being a non-performing asset," realizes Do-Ye0n.

"That's not the accepted terminology. You're being released because your incarceration is not in anyone's best interest. Pack your socks, you're sleeping at your own place tonight."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once again, he's in level one housing with just enough internet for what is required of him. He sits up from the folding desk and walks to the communal bathroom. Pees and flushes and walks back to his hell.

"Alex, what do you have for me today?" Do-Ye0n summons his job-search counselor.

"Hello Do-Ye0n," Alex smiles. "Sorry, I have nothing for you today."

"Fine. Broaden the search filter. I'll look at anything."

"I've already done that. I have nothing for you today."

"Nothing?"

"Nothing," confirmed Alex. "Your ranked performance has dipped below the employable threshold."

"Why did that happen?" says Alex. He uses his outdoor voice, but knows it won't really change Alex's behavior.

"You recently received a sub-standard performance review from the Hammurabi corporation," Alex says, smiling. "They rated you lower than the top 20% of performing assets."

"I was a prisoner!" Do-Ye0n now uses his outdoor voice with gusto. "They can't rank my performance."

"Hammurabi combines performance of incarcerated assets with their traditionally employed assets. It is part of their annual report and statement of financial condition."

"They can't!"

"It is an accepted accounting practice. Otherwise, they would have to declare incarcerated labor as short-term assets, in which case they would be forced to depreciate your value over five years. The law prevents attaching value to a person. So they are forced to report incarcerated productivity as part of overall productivity."

Do-Ye0n angrily shuts the conversation. He looks around the small room. He smells chlorine and urine. He hears the neighbors fighting.

Nobody sleeps on the streets, but Do-Ye0n fantasizes about it.
