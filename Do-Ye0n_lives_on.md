Nobody sleeps on the streets, although Do-Ye0n fantasizes about it.

Nobody sleeps on the streets since 2052 when housing was voted a right.

Nobody sleeps on the streets, but if Do-Ye0n wasn't assigned to this level one apartment, he could choose where he slept, instead of these recyclable sheets and pillow. He could choose what he smelled, instead of the odor of chlorine and urine from the cassette toilet. He could choose his neighbors, instead of the screaming and thumping of the genetic cesspool collective living on the other side of the shared wall. He could have his freedom.

But he doesn't. And he's stuck here with all the internet he needs.

Not enough for entertainment, but enough to look for work, pay bills, order food-only the essentials. Because he's supposed to become a contributing member of society. Or he'll lose his basic rights.

If he loses his rights, then he *will* sleep on the streets, fantasy or not.

Do-Ye0n ranks at 95% in vehicle AI engineering. He's known in the industry. He's shunned by the industry.

He has no choice but to open the first job offer of the day. It's a contract gig, just like every other from the past four months. It requires advanced skills but offers a minimum payout. This is what he gets after hijacking autonomous vehicles and probably (*not proven or convicted*) killing two people. He accepts and completes the project in two short hours, completing his daily contribution requirement. But that payment doesn't get him out of this apartment.

If he can find long term work, he can move someplace that doesn't stink. Day gigs are a gerbil-wheel for losers. He opens up the job search counselor - an artificial coach with a cheery attitude.

"Do-Ye0n," says the coach. His nametag says *Alex* in a comic-book font. "Welcome back. I don't have anything for your current profile. Would you like some suggestions?"

"Yes. Please broaden the industries you are searching. In fact, please remove the automotive sector entirely. It's obvious they don't want me, so let's move on."

"Done," says Alex without hesitation. "Removing the automotive search restriction produces two good matches; cybersecurity and agricultural. Which would you like to start with?"

"Which pays better?"

"Cybersecurity. It is corporate network penetrative testing."

"Ransomware, you mean." Do-Ye0n frowns. "What does it pay?"

"It is ranked in the top 30% of compensation plans, includes level four housing and grants stock options every quarter." Alex smiles. "They have reviewed your resume and are extending an offer. Shall I tell them you are able to start?"

"Yes," says Do-Ye0n. Companies involved in ransomware are...

Volume 2

Do-Ye0n lives on

1)  publicly traded ransomware companies
2)  arrests based on profitability
3)  bail as recruitment tactic
4)  betting (short and long) on results of conviction
5)  incarceration by public companies
6)  early release based on job interview and desirability of candidate (prisoner)

Do-Ye0n Kurrat is a penetrative tester in automotive ai security.

Companies hire p.testers to ward off ransom ware. But they also use that tech to spy on other companies - intl and domestic. Which is hard to tell the difference.

Sometimes companies run afoul of politicians. Political slogan : "Screw Them!"

Scapegoats are sacrificed (dyk!). I.e. engineers that designed Volkswagen diesel algorithm.

Prosecution of corporate illegal behavior is a competitive strategy. "If you can't beat them, then jail them." Find a way to lock up strategic employees.

"Our assets walk out of the door each evening. We have to make sure that they come back the next morning."

Dyk enters the criminal economy
