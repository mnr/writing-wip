If we rise, we die. If we sink, we die. Floating is life. Floating is hard.

Venus plays a game with this platform. The game is "Let's Kill Mark and all his friends." The rules are simple: If everything works, we live. If something fails, then it's Venus 1, Mark 0. Venus gets to play again. We don't.

Venus was expensive. Hard launch all the parts to orbit. Robots build the ship. Soft launch us to orbit. We fly the ship. Actually, we made sure the ship flew the ship. And "fly" is a misnomer, there isn't any flight without atmosphere. It's accurate to say we fell towards Venus. It's actually better to say we "spun" towards Venus, since it's rotational motion that got us here. Thank you physics, for being so predictable.

We float in the atmosphere and go around the planet every four days. If we're careful, we float at 52 kilometers at a comfy Earth-like temperature with access to water vapor and oxygen. We talk with Earth every two days for two days, then slip to the night side for two days of quiet time. 

The surface of Venus takes 243 days to rotate the same distance. Between the surface and the atmosphere is tides and gravity and rotation and temperature. Venus likes to melt lead at its surface. If we didn't melt, we could to talk with earth for 121 days, which would be mostly us screaming in pain. Then we'd slip to the night side with no oxygen and no earth and that would be death. So let's not do that.

So we float.

Despite the harsh conditions on the surface, the atmospheric pressure and temperature at about 50 km to 65 km above the surface of the planet is nearly the same as that of the Earth, making its upper atmosphere the most Earth-like area in the [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System), even more so than the surface of [Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars). Due to the similarity in pressure and temperature and the fact that breathable air (21% [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen), 78% [nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen)) is a [lifting gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifting_gas) on Venus in the same way that [helium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium) is a lifting gas on Earth, the upper atmosphere has been proposed as a location for both [exploration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observations_and_explorations_of_Venus)and [colonization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization_of_Venus).[[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Venus#cite_note-Landis2003-9) - wikipedia
