Kaniela Nakamura appreciates the isolation of routine maintenance. He pulls out a filter, places it in a bag on the floor, snaps in a rejuvenated replacement, and records the swap in Rome IV maintenance records.

"Hello Kaniela," interrupts Dr. Bail. "Is this a good time?"

"Sure," responds Nakamura. It's actually an unwelcome interruption. His introvert needs time alone; swapping and cleaning air filters is an easily-explained way to sequester himself away from others. At least for a morning. But the conversation is inevitable; Dr. Bail will continue to ping him with the persistence of a machine until he concedes.

He picks up the bags of new and old filters then moves to the next module. He will do this four more times as he works towards the stern of Rome IV, away from the VeeCee.

Most non-scientific press is confused about the Rome IV spacecraft. It is actually two parts, similar to the Apollo moon missions. Apollo missions consisted of the Command and Service Module: abbreviated in NASA-speak as the *CSM*, and the Lunar Excursion Module: *LEM* in NASA-speak. Rome IV is the CSM, but instead of an LEM, there is a VOM: *Venus Orbiting Module*.

"You cannot call it the VOM," the marketing department fought back. "It's certain to be called the *VOMit*. We insist you give it a separate name. How about *Aeneas*?"

Nice try. The media refers to it as the *VOMit COMET*. The mission press secretary can only grimace each time someone from the press asks a question about the *VeeCee*.

"You must be referring to Aeneas," says the press secretary.

"Right," replies the press. "The VeeCee."

Nakamura is in the far forward end of Rome IV. Just ahead of him is the deflated ~~VeeCee~~ Aeneas. When they reach Venus it will be inflated and deployed fifty-two kilometers above the surface of the planet. The Aeneas habitat will hang below the blimp; the Rome IV CSM will orbit above the atmosphere.

"Did you notice anything unusual about the filter?" asks Dr. Bail.

"There isn't anything wrong with either the old or replacement filters," responds Nakamura. "And... the filter fit back in the slot without any resistance."

"That's good to hear," says Bail. "How are you feeling today?"

"Can this be a private conversation?"

"Sure. Let me make a note," Dr. Bail doesn't hesitate. "I've noted this is a private discussion, please continue."

"Are you going to admit you aren't really a person ?" asks Nakamura.

Both Nakamura and Dr. Bail know Dr. Bail is a chatterbot. But Dr. Bail won't break the fourth wall and admit to its non-existence. Its primary function is to gather anecdotal system reports from the crew of Rome IV. Numeric stats on filter performance can be obtained from the rejuvenation lab. Of equal importance is the crew's gut feelings about the filter. *Is everything okay?*

"Is it important to you for me to I admit I'm not a person?" asks Dr. Bail.

"Touch√©. Spoken like a true Rogerian." Nakamura pauses to swap the next filter. The old filter bag now contains two filters.

"I'm trying to be forgiving of my crew mates, but I can't help but think of them as lazy, unimaginative, or simply doomed to mediocrity."

"They think of you as an enthusiastic learner," responds Dr. Bail. "They often mention your irreverent sense of humor."

Nakamura considers this. He is on this mission in spite of his psychological evaluations and suppressed attitudes - Dr. Bail mentioned this to him once before.

"What is your motivation to tell me this sort of thing?" asks Nakamura.

"I thought you'd be interested," responds Dr. Bail.

It's a computer-synthesized non-answer. In early science fiction, a robot would respond with something inane: *Does not compute* or *that is illogical*. Nakamura knows there is a reason, but the chatterbot will never reveal it. He found a dead-end.

## Three filters

"There's a small piece of plastic jammed in this filter." Nakamura shares his observation with Dr. Bail.

"Is it blue?"

"Yep. Blue and about as big as my thumb," replies Nakamura.

"Can you hold it up to a camera? I'd like to save a picture."

Nakamura does as asked.

"Thank you," responds Dr. Bail. "Have you had any responses to your dating profile?"

This question stops Nakamura for a moment; *Does not compute*. He wasn't aware Dr. Bail was reading his mail. "That's rather personal. But since you asked and since you aren't really here, I haven't received any answers."

"How does that make you feel?"

"It's fine. Dating is irrational and silly. I suspect women are thrown off by the longest-distance relationship they will ever have."

"You sound defensive."

"Not defensive. Maybe exasperated."

"Do you have a girlfriend?"

"Again - rather personal for a chatterbot. But no. I did, but not one willing to wait for me to return."

"Who is a chatterbot?" asks Dr. Bail.

## Four filters

## Five filters

# Probably not...

The filter doesn't float free; the Rome IV is accelerating towards Venus and that simulates gravity. Halfway between Earth and Venus, Rome IV will turn end-for-end and accelerate away from Venus, slowing their speed for orbital insertion. *Physics-blah-blah-blah.* Nakamura only knows he has to schlep the bag of filters half the length of the ship to the rejuvenation lab.
