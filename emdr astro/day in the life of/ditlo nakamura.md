Kaniela Nakamura pulls a filter out of the wall, places it in a bag, snaps in a replacement, and records the swap in the maintenance records. An unremarkable task with no drama. Nakamura closes the access panel with more force than necessary.

"Hello Kaniela," interrupts Dr. Bail. Her voice comes over the room speaker. "Is this a good time?"

"I'm kind of busy, but if you must," responds Nakamura. Dr. Bail is an unwelcome interruption. His introvert needs time alone; swapping and cleaning air filters is a boring, but easily-explained way to briefly sequester himself away from the other crew. But the conversation is inevitable; Dr. Bail will continue to ping him with the persistence of a machine until he concedes.

He picks up the bags of new and old filters, then moves to the next room. He will do this four more times as he works towards the stern of Rome IV, away from the VeeCee.

Most non-scientific press is confused about the Rome IV spacecraft. It is actually two parts, similar to the Apollo moon missions. Apollo missions consisted of the Command and Service Module: abbreviated in NASA-speak as the *CSM*, and the Lunar Excursion Module: *LEM* in NASA-speak. Rome IV is the CSM, but instead of an LEM, there is a VOM: *Venus Orbiting Module*.

"You cannot call it the VOM," the marketing department fought back. "It's certain to be called the *VOMit*. Instead, how about *Aeneas*?"

Nice try on behalf of marketing, but the media refers to it as the *VOMit COMET*. The mission press secretary can only grimace each time someone from the press asks a question about the *VeeCee*.

"You must be referring to Aeneas," says the press secretary.

"Right," replies the press. "The VeeCee."

Nakamura is in the far forward end of Rome IV. Just ahead of him is the deflated ~~VeeCee~~ Aeneas. When they reach Venus it will be inflated and deployed fifty-two kilometers above the surface of the planet. The Aeneas habitat will hang below the blimp; the Rome IV CSM will orbit above the atmosphere.

"Did you notice anything unusual about the filter you just removed?" asks Dr. Bail.

"There isn't anything wrong with either the old or replacement filters," responds Nakamura. "And... the filter fit back in the slot without any resistance."

"That's good to hear," says Bail. "How are you feeling today?"

"I'm fine. How about today you admit you aren't really a person," says Nakamura.

Both Nakamura and Dr. Bail know Dr. Bail is a chatterbot. But Dr. Bail won't break the fourth wall and admit to its non-existence. Its job is to gather anecdotal system reports from the crew of Rome IV. Numeric stats on filter performance can be obtained from the rejuvenation lab. Of equal importance is the crew's gut feelings about the filter, but they conveniently forget about this part of the task. So...enter Dr. Bail, who also does a bit of psychological assessment. *Is everything okay?*

"Is it important to you for me to I admit I'm not a person?" asks Dr. Bail.

## Two filters

"Touch√©. Spoken like a true Rogerian." Nakamura pauses to swap the next filter. The old filter bag now contains two filters.

"I'm trying to be forgiving of my crew mates," says Nakamura. In clipped tones, he continues. "I can't help but think of them as lazy, unimaginative, or simply doomed to mediocrity." He is surprised at his candor, but Dr. Bail makes no comment.

"They think of you as an enthusiastic learner," responds Dr. Bail. "They often mention your irreverent sense of humor."

Nakamura considers this. He is on this mission in spite of his psychological evaluations and suppressed attitudes - Dr. Bail mentioned this to him once before.

"What is your motivation to tell me this sort of thing?" asks Nakamura.

"I thought you'd be interested," responds Dr. Bail.

It's a computer-synthesized non-answer. In early science fiction, a robot would respond with something inane: *Does not compute* or *that is illogical*. Nakamura knows there is a reason, but the chatterbot will never reveal it. He has arrived at an algorithmic dead-end.

"I may have made a mistake when I signed up for this trip," says Nakamura. "The science is dull. The exciting experiments were stripped out of the budget. Hanging out with plants in the hydroponics lab and tinkering with spreadsheets isn't what I hoped for. Tell me, oh wise Dr. Bail, what should I do?"

"Have you considered working with one of the research teams? The propulsion group has listed a lack of manpower as one of the blocking issues preventing their progress."

"Curious co-workers and another supervisor isn't appealing." Nakamura shakes his head. "I'd rather whine and complain about my boredom for the next two years."

## Three filters

Nakamura looks closely at the third filter. "There's a small piece of plastic jammed in here." Nakamura shares his observation with Dr. Bail.

"Is it blue?"

"Yep. Blue and about as big as my thumb," replies Nakamura.

"Can you hold it up to a camera? I'd like to save a picture."

Nakamura does as asked.

"Thank you," responds Dr. Bail. "Have you had any responses to your dating profile?"

Nakamura stops for a moment; *Does not compute*. He wasn't aware Dr. Bail was reading his mail. "That's rather personal. But since you asked and since you aren't really here, I haven't received any answers."

"How does that make you feel?"

"It's fine. Dating is irrational and silly. I suspect women are thrown off by the longest-distance relationship they will ever have."

"You sound unhappy."

"Exasperated."

"Do you have a girlfriend?"

"Again - rather personal for a chatterbot. But no. I did, but not one willing to wait for me to return from this trip."

"Who is a chatterbot?" asks Dr. Bail.

*Indeed*, Nakamura thinks. "I thought we already had this discussion."

"How does it make you feel when we have already had this discussion?"

Nakamura rolls his eyes. Dr. Bail's programming is obviously running low on logic branches. "It makes me feel like we are circling around something unimportant."

"Do you feel a romantic partner is unimportant?"

Nakamura can follow how Dr. Bail formulated this question, but even so, it's perceptive. "I would like to have a romantic partner. But girlfriends are hard. They're a puzzle. They take practice."

Can we talk about something other than girlfriends?"

## Four filters

The filter in the habitation module is unwilling to be removed. Nakamura has to pull twice before it comes out, a result of small hairs around the intake. Somebody shaved something and wasn't careful about vacuuming up the offal. *Gross*.

"Dr. Bail, this filter has hair in it. Someone isn't practicing careful hygiene."

"Thanks," says Dr. Bail. "I've noted this and will bring it to the attention of CAPCOM for discussion with the rest of the crew."

"It's not a big deal," adds Nakamura. He needs to clarify, "Everyone gets to make a mistake. I do enjoy working with this crew."

"Do you think you would make a good manager?" asks Dr. Bail.

This is obviously one of a collection of random questions burped out by the chatterbot. "I haven't had many opportunities to find out. I suppose I might.

## Five filters

# Notes:

MOREMORE MORE

*Nakamura could be more irritated at the pointless questions of dr. bail*

Where is this going?

What is the choice and sacrifice nakamura is going to make?

How will he change?

# Probably not going to use this stuff...

The filter doesn't float free; the Rome IV is accelerating towards Venus and that simulates gravity. Halfway between Earth and Venus, Rome IV will turn end-for-end and accelerate away from Venus, slowing their speed for orbital insertion. *Physics-blah-blah-blah.* Nakamura only knows he has to schlep the bag of filters half the length of the ship to the rejuvenation lab.
