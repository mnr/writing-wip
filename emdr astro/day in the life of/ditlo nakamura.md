Kaniela Nakamura appreciates the isolation of routine maintenance. He tries to be forgiving of his crew mates, but his unvoiced evaluation finds them lazy, unimaginative, or simply doomed to mediocrity. Nakamura is on this mission in spite of his psychological evaluations and suppressed attitudes; his fellow astronauts find him an enthusiastic learner with an irreverent sense of humor. But his introvert needs time alone; swapping and cleaning air filters is an easily-explained way to sequester himself away from others. At least for a morning.

He pulls out a filter, places it in a bag on the floor, snaps in a rejuvenated replacement, and records the swap in Aeneas maintenance records. He will do this ten more times as he works towards the stern of Aeneas, away from the VeeCee.

Most non-scientific media is confused about the Aeneas spacecraft. Its actually two parts, similar to the Apollo moon missions. Apollo missions consisted of the Command and Service Module: abbreviated in NASA-speak as the *CSM*, and the Lunar Excursion Module: *LEM* in NASA-speak. Aeneas has a CSM, but instead of an LEM, it has a VOM: *Venus Orbiting Module*.

"You cannot call it the VOM," the marketing department fought back. "It's certain to be called the *VOMit*." Which was almost true; instead, the media referred to it as the *VOMit COMET*. The mission press secretary could only grimace each time someone from the press asked a question about the *VeeCee*.

Nakamura is in the far forward end of Aeneas. Just ahead of him is the deflated VeeCee. When they reach Venus it will be inflated and deployed fifty-two kilometers above the surface of the planet. The Aeneas habitat will hang below the blimp; the Aeneas CSM will orbit above the atmosphere.

The filter doesn't float free; the Aeneas is accelerating towards Venus and that simulates gravity. Halfway between Earth and Venus, Aeneas will turn end-for-end and accelerate away from Venus, slowing their speed for orbital insertion. *Physics-blah-blah-blah.* Nakamura only knows he has to schlep the bag of filters half the length of the ship to the rejuvenation lab.

"Hello Kaniela," interrupts Dr. Bail. "Is this a good time?"

"Sure," responds Nakamura. Its actually an unwelcome interruption, but the conversation is inevitable; Dr. Bail will continue to ping him with the persistence of a machine until he concedes.
