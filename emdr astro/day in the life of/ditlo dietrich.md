The hull crawler is stuck just below the window, snagged in a crack in the spaceship plating.

Ellen Dietrich hovers in the window overlooking the stern end of the Aeneas spaceship. The forward window provides a view of Venus, their destination. If she looks down through the top side of this window she can see the crawler; at least, both of its eyes and one manipulator. It is twitching, unable to reach the next grab point. One of the other five legs are unable to release and prevent forward motion. Ellen is unable to see which.

It reminds her of blue crabs in Onancock, Virginia on the Chesapeake Bay. The crabs watched her from the shallow water, calculating the risk of danger from above against the reward of food at hand. They were in water deep enough to be out of reach, just like this crawler is out of reach.

She can see herself from the crawler's video camera. This close, the video is crisp and detailed. It shows her behind the window; a thirty-something mom with brunette hair, standing against the one-gee acceleration. The window glass stands in for the surface of the water the Chesapeake Bay crabs must have looked through. She doesn't think she was threatening, but the crabs back home behaved otherwise.

An inoperable crawler isn't a big deal. There are three of them onboard and with enough time, "Huey" or "Dewey" can be summoned to rescue "Louie," this stuck crawler.

The crawler isn't a big deal, but the radio array is. Unlike Louie, the broken connector to the array is in Dietrich's full view. Until today the array worked and the connector looked intact. Shortly before station wake-up, the array failed and a bare wire now indicates the point of failure. The sum of insignificant vibrations finally broke through the insulation and stopped the signal from station to earth.

She should be focused on the routine of the day; finishing scheduled maintenance, swapping and cleaning filters, recording gas and fluid levels. An endless list of long-term and boring tedium necessary for the health of this ship. Instead, she is focused on this novel malfunction. Somebody would have to solve it eventually, so why not now and why not her?

Kim would withhold his thoughts on her priorities, thereby making it clear she should focus on the tedium. Kim is her partner and father of Charlie, a steady response to her flighty call. He gave her room to be detached and patience when she tried to change him. She gave him intimacy, but not open emotions. They built a child who was happy to live on earth, with Kim, at the parenting collective.

***(the crawler is an analogy for her relationships; romantic and parent/child. How she fixes the crawler is how she will fix her relationships)***
