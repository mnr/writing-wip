The hull crawler is stuck just below the window.

Ellen Dietrich hovers in the window overlooking the stern end of the Aeneas spaceship. The forward window provides a view of Venus, their destination. If she looks down through the top side of this window she can see the crawler; at least, both of its eyes and one manipulator. It is twitching, unable to reach the next grab point. It is somehow snagged, but Ellen can't see far enough to know why.

It reminds her of blue crabs in Onancock, Virginia on the Chesapeake Bay. The crabs watched her from the shallow water, calculating the risk of danger from above against the reward of food at hand. They were in water deep enough to be out of reach, just like this crawler is out of reach.

She can see herself from the crawler's video camera. This close, the video is crisp and detailed. It shows her behind the window; a thirty-something mom with brunette hair, standing against the one-gee acceleration. The window glass stands in for the surface of the water the Chesapeake Bay crabs must have looked through. She doesn't think she was threatening, but the crabs back home behaved otherwise.

An inoperable crawler isn't a big deal. There are three of them on-board and with enough time, "Huey" or "Dewey" can be summoned to rescue "Louie," this stuck crawler.

Unlike the crawler, the high-gain antenna is a big deal. Until this morning, it worked and the connector looked intact. Shortly before station wake-up, the antenna failed and a broken wire is visible to the right of the window. The sum of insignificant vibrations finally broke through the insulation and stopped the signal from station to earth to station. The low-gain antennas are doing their best to keep the data flow up to speed, but any unnecessary communication is halted - until the primary antenna is fixed

It's counter-intuitive, but she should follow the daily routine; scheduled maintenance, swapping and cleaning filters, recording gas and fluid levels. An endless list of long-term and boring tedium necessary for the health of this ship. The antenna is broken, it isn't going to get any more broken. Other systems are working and routine maintenance will keep them in operation. But instead, she is irrationally focused on this novel malfunction .

Kim, her partner and father to Charlie, learned not to re-direct her obsessions. Kim was steady, a good partner for someone with an aversion to boredom and attraction to novel challenges. He gave her room to be detached and was patience when she tried to change him. She gave him intimacy, but not emotions. They built a child who was happy to live on earth, with Kim, at the parenting collective. Ellen was happy to be on the Aeneas, staring down a stuck crawler, broken cable, and inoperable antenna.

Kim is a more forceful parent than Ellen. On hikes, Ellen would be far ahead, assuming Kim and Charlie would explore and learn on their own time; Ellen wasn't going to force education on Charlie, nor would she force enjoyment on Kim. More than once, when Kim and Charlie caught up there were harsh words about the "family" hike and Ellen's lack of participation. Yes, a hike was for physical exercise; but it was also a bonding experience and a chance to share interests and viewpoints. By charging off, Ellen missed that experience. That was Kim's view - Ellen saw it as giving them space for unsupervised learning.

When she noticed the broken cable, she summoned Louie. This is the practical thing to do. Then the crawler snagged. The logical thing is to add the antenna - and crawler - as maintenance to be done during the EVA scheduled later today. But she doesn't; there ought to be a way to fix everything from here, right now.

She needs more eyes on the problem.

"Huey," Ellen said. "Move to my location."

"Huey will arrive in twenty minutes," Aeneas responds. This seems like a long time - but it's infinitely quicker than suiting up herself. The crawlers are methodical and know the shortest path from their storage garage to any point on the ship. She would just have to wait.

Accepting the flight to Venus was a ten-month commitment, plus a year of intense preparation and years of exhaustive follow-up. Kim chafed at this project, comparing it to her mode of participation in family hikes. She didn't see the problem; Charlie had a great school, a great parenting community, and a great father. Kim had a monogamous partner with a good income, which provided him with the time and financial security to pursue his carpentry. Regardless, her departure was not a positive step forward in the relationship; Kim doubted the relationship would be intact when she returned.

She hadn't heard from Kim and Charlie today; personal communication is only done through the broken antenna - so no personal communication. The lack of contact isn't her motivation to fix the antenna; the challenge to fix the problem is enough all by itself. But she has a bit of time - enough to queue up a message.

"Hi Kim. Hi Charlie. I'm still out here, putzing along to Venus. Stuff is broken so I can't send this right away but I'll send this as soon as it's fixed.

I've been thinking about our family. You've mentioned I'm distant and don't seem invested in the relationship. Well - I'm certainly distant now - and will be for another year - but I think it's wrong to say I'm not invested. It's only that I want you to be free to pursue your life the same way I pursue mine."

Aeneas chimed. "Huey has arrived at your location." Sure enough, a second crawler was peeking over the left edge of the window, waiting for instructions. Ellen nudged Huey to get a better view of Louie; she could now see how the stuck crawler had jammed two legs into one grab-point, wedging itself in place and unable to release it's grip.

"Huey, mimic my hand movements," Ellen tells the crawler. It's actually Aeneas that watches her hand, then transfers the positions to Huey, but that's unnecessary detail - Huey does as it's told.

Watching from Huey's perspective, she moves closer to Louie's back leg reaches out to grab the jammed leg. She can just touch Louie, but can't get enough of a grip to free the leg.

"Can't free the crawler, but at least I can fix the antenna." Ellen moves Huey towards the broken cable until it stops. Louie is blocking the grab points Huey will need to get close enough to repair the cable. "Curses, foiled again."

If Kim were here he would be silently broadcasting his frustration with Ellen and her unpredictability. Charlie would dive in, grab controls and flail towards a solution. She hated that about Kim, loved that about Charlie. She loved that Kim gave her space to fail, hated that Charlies energy forced her to act sooner than she was ready.

"Dewey, come to the right side of this window."

"Are you sure?" Aeneas interrupts. "This will move all crawlers to one location. An accident may cause the loss of Huey, Dewey, and Louie."

"I confirm my request," says Ellen. Again, the smart thing would be to include this as part of the maintenance to be performed later today. But she is obsessed with this situation and is willing to double-down on her solution. For the briefest of moments, she is aware of making a commitment on behalf of the entire project and crew.

"Dewey will arrive in five minutes," Aeneas says. It's an acceptance of Ellen's request without agreeing. Just like Kim might accept a request from Ellen.

She fantasized about being less independent with Charlie, more compliant for Kim. "*Kim, what do you think? Should we fix this ourselves, or call in the entire crew for consultation?"* She could voice the request inside her head, but even in the privacy of the lab she couldn't bring herself to voice it out loud.

(what does she have to sacrifice?)
