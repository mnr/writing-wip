The hull crawler is stuck just below the window, somehow snagged.

Ellen Dietrich hovers in the window overlooking the stern end of the Aeneas spaceship. The opposing window provides a view of Venus, their destination. If she looks down through the top side of the window she can see the crawler; at least, both of its eyes and one manipulator. It is twitching, unable to reach the next grab point. One of the other five legs are unable to release and prevent forward motion. Ellen is unable to see which.

It reminds her of blue crabs in Onancock, Virginia on the Chesapeake Bay. Crabs watched her from the shallow water, calculating the risk of danger from above against the reward of food at hand. They were in water deep enough to be out of reach, just like this crawler is out of reach.

She can see herself from the crawler's video camera. This close, the video is crisp and detailed. It shows her behind the window; a thirty-something mom, brunette hair standing up in zero-gee. The glass of the window stands in for the surface of the water the Chesapeake Bay crabs must have looked through. She doesn't think she looks threatening, but the crabs back home behaved otherwise.

An inoperable crawler isn't a big deal. There are three crawlers onboard and with enough time, "Huey" or "Dewey" can be summoned to rescue "Louie," this stuck crawler.

The crawler isn't a big deal, but the radio array is. Unlike Louie, the broken connector to the array is in Dietrich's full view. Until today the array worked fine and the connector looked intact. Shortly before station wake-up, the array failed and a bare wire clearly indicates the point of failure. The sum of insignificant vibrations finally broke through the insulation and stopped the signal from station to earth.

She should be focused on the routine of the day; finishing scheduled maintenance, swapping and cleaning filters, recording gas and fluid levels. Other long-term and boring tedium.
