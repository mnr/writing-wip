The hull crawler is stuck just below the window, snagged in a seam or handrail. If she looks down through the top side of the window she can see both of its eyes and one manipulator. It is twitching, unable to reach the next grab point. One of the other five legs are unable to release and prevented forward motion. Ellen is unable to see which. The onboard cameras are pointed forward, towards her. She can't see the backside of the crawler.

This is just like growing up in Onancock, Virginia. Blue crabs looked up from the shallow water, calculating the risk of danger from above against the reward of food at hand. They were in water deep enough to be out of reach, just like this crawler is out of reach.

An inoperable crawler isn't a big deal. There are three crawlers onboard and with enough time, "Huey" or "Dewey" can be summoned to rescue "Louie," this stuck crawler.
