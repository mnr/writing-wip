Flashing red lights are never welcome. Never on a spaceship. Never at the start of a maintenance task. Ellen clears the error light, it turns green, then immediately back to red.

The broken thing is a multiplexer / demultiplexer. It's bolted to the outside of the ship, nearby the antenna pointed at Earth. Astronauts call it an "MDM" when they're in a hurry or trying to sound important.

She *should* add this to the maintenance schedule, then move on to the rest of today's tasks. These are an endless list of long-term and boring tedium necessary for the health of this ship. The MDM is broken, it will not become any more broken. Other systems are working and her attention to routine maintenance will keep them in operation.

She *would* add this to the maintenance schedule, but today is different. She just received a message from Charlie. He was in tears because his father wouldn't let him go barefoot to school.

> Jim, Charlie's father and Ellen's partner, hovers in the background. His arms are crossed, lips are tight. Ellen knows the look. Jim was often angry the last two years. It makes Ellen angry and impatient.

If you saw the MDM at a garage sale, you'd pick it up with one hand, squint at the identification plate, then put it back on the table with the other miscellaneous stereo parts. You'd assume it's nothing remarkable.

But it is remarkable. The MDM is one of two devices operating the high-gain antenna, transmitting data from the Rome IV spacecraft. When this MDM failed, the backup took over. If the backup fails, Rome IV will fall back to low-gain antennas. Bandwidth would drop 100-fold. This would be a bad thing. Nobody has died, but this non-operational MDM is making many people very unhappy.

There ought to be a way to fix things from here, right now.

> "I'm pregnant," she told Jim, six months after meeting him at a subcontractor meet-and-greet. A baby was a new development, but she was curious enough about parenthood to pursue it. Like she pursued Jim. He was a puzzle, with his emotions and romantic rituals. He insisted on making the bed when he slept over, said it honored the relationship.
>
> Jim was more enthusiastic about the pregnancy than Ellen was prepared for. He was the oldest of his siblings and had helped raise the last child. He knew how to do it. They moved into a two-bedroom apartment within a month, enrolled in pre-natal courses, started eating *really* healthy. She chafed a bit at the endless list of demands necessary for the health of this child, but she cooperated.

"Please send a crawler to my location," says Ellen.

"I'll be there in five minutes," responds Louise. The voice sounds like an adult woman, but it actually belongs to one of the three hull crawlers on-board the Rome IV spacecraft. They move around outside, anchoring themselves against the one gee acceleration of Rome IV.

Crawlers are mechanical crabs with tools instead of pincers, easy to use for quick repairs. They always have three of six legs attached, never from the same side. Detachment from the hull would cause falling down a bottomless pit, forever lost to the ship. The alternative is a human suiting up for a spacewalk, a difficult activity requiring days of preparation, shutting down the drive, and subsequent recovery from the exercise.

Huey, the second of three crawlers, is twice the size of Louise and carries stronger manipulators. It has an adult man's voice. Dewey, the third crawler, has a young boy's voice and is half the size of Louise. Dewey is the quickest and nimblest of the three.

The voices aren't intended to make them human. Rather, it provides the astronauts aboard Rome IV quick confirmation of which crawler they are working with. The crawlers have a bit of intelligence, but only enough to plot the shortest route between two points, find the best grab point, recognize components, and perform simple actions.

This hasn't stopped other (bored) members of the crew from using the crawlers to put on performances. The recording of Dewey and Huey performing "Who's On First" is viral.

> "What are you eating?" asked Jim. She said she would be home for dinner tonight, but was late (*again*) at the flight simulator. Jim had called and watched her through a video conference.
>
> "It's a bologna sandwich from the robo-chef," she replied. "I'm hungry."
>
> "Great," says Jim with a sarcastic roll of his eyes. He holds a plate of ratatouille with eggs in front of the camera. "By the time you get home, this will be cold."
>
> "I'm sure what you've made will still be delicious when I get home," Ellen tells Jim through the video. "My ETA is fifteen minutes. We can have dinner, then compare notes on how we got pregnant."

Ellen braces herself in the observation bubble overlooking the stern end of Rome IV. A forward window provides a view of Venus, their destination. To her right is the recalcitrant MDM. She stands in a small room filled with camera controls and monitors; it's the most scenic room on the ship and a popular place to contemplate the universe.

"I have arrived," says Louise.

When Ellen looks down through the top side of the window, she can see Louise; at least, both of its eyes and one arm. It reminds her of blue crabs in Onancock, Virginia on the Chesapeake Bay back home. The crabs watched her from the shallow water, calculating the risk of danger from above against the reward of food at hand. They were in water deep enough to be out of reach, just like this crawler is out of reach.

To Ellen's right is a monitor fed from Louise's camera. Ellen can see herself; a thirty-something mom with brunette hair.

"Louise, mimic my hand," Ellen instructs the crawler. She reaches toward the MDM; Louise does the same. Ellen reaches for the access door, intending to twist a handle and view the internal diagnostic lights. But Louise can't reach far enough.

"Louise, move closer to the MDM."

The video lurches, but Louise remains where it is. Ellen can see the crawler twitching, unable to reach the next grab point. Ellen can't see why.

This snafu becomes more complex and, for Ellen, more interesting. She puts down the maintenance clipboard and tries to get a better look at Louise's rear legs. She's obsessed with fixing the MDM.

> Jim learned not to re-direct her obsessions. Jim is steady, a suitable partner for someone with an aversion to boredom and attraction to novel challenges. They built a child who was happy to live on earth, with Jim, at the parenting collective. She loves Charlie. She loves Jim. She misses them both, but was driven to be on the Rome IV, staring down a stuck crawler, broken box, and inoperable antenna.

She needs more eyes to see what's wrong.

"Huey," Ellen says. "Move to my location."

"I'll be there in ten minutes," Huey responds. This seems like a long time - but it's infinitely quicker than suiting up herself. The crawlers are methodical and know the shortest path from their garage to any point on the ship. She will just have to wait.

> Jim is a more hands-on parent than Ellen. On hikes, Ellen would be far ahead, assuming Jim and Charlie would explore and learn on their own time; Ellen would not force education on Charlie, nor would she force enjoyment on Jim.
>
> More than once, when Jim and Charlie caught up to her, there were harsh words about the "family" hike and Ellen's lack of participation. Yes, Jim agreed, a hike was for physical exercise; but it was also a bonding experience and a chance to share interests and viewpoints. By charging off, Ellen missed that experience. That was Jim's view - Ellen disagreed; she saw it as giving them space for unsupervised learning.

Accepting the flight to Venus was a ten-month commitment, plus a year of intense preparation and years of exhaustive follow-up. Jim chafed at this project, comparing it to her mode of participation in family hikes. She didn't understand; Charlie goes to an elite school and has a caring father. Jim has a faithful partner with a good income.

> They were remodeling the house. She ordered a pre-fab kitchen from Ikea, set to arrive tomorrow.
>
> Jim tried to convince her to stop, create a plan, debate alternatives, get three bids from contractors, watch several tutorials. Charlie was ready to dive in and flail towards a solution. She hated that about Jim, loved that about Charlie.

Charlie sent messages when Jim felt the need, but they were becoming less frequent. The loss of this antenna would reduce these messages even further. The lack of contact isn't her motivation to fix the antenna; the challenge to fix the problem is enough all by itself.

"I have arrived," Huey interrupts. Sure enough, a second crawler is peeking over the left edge of the window, waiting for instructions.

"Huey, move so you can see Louise's backside." Ellen tells Huey to move, then snickers. Is this an HR violation? Someone on earth will review this later and hopefully have a laugh. Huey makes no comment and moves into place.

Now Ellen can see how the tip of one leg has passed through the grab point and wedged into the clamp at the end of another leg. Getting it free will require three hands. Ellen wonders if she could just use Huey to give Louise a hard yank. It might work, or it might not, or it might bust something else.

> Ellen had experimented with being different. Charlie had dug up Jim's garden, looking for treasure.
>
> "Jim, you're right. Charlie shouldn't have been exploring in your garden." Ellen had been reading *Treasure Island* to Charlie.
>
> "Dammit, it's not about exploring," Jim had exploded. "It's about limits. It's about understanding the long picture. He can't just be running feral all the time."
>
> But it is all about being feral. About exploring. It is what she does for a living. Jim travels a straight and narrow to get to his carpentry. Charlie should swerve and deviate course.

"Huey, mimic my hand movements," Ellen says. Watching from Huey's perspective, she moves closer to Louise's back leg and reaches out to grab the jammed leg. She can just touch Louise, but can't get enough of a grip to free the leg.

"*Can't free the crawler, but at least I can fix the antenna.*" Ellen moves Huey towards the broken MDM until it stops. Louise is blocking the grab points Huey needs. "*Curses, foiled again.*" she thinks. Maybe a smaller crab can maneuver.

"Dewey, come to the right side of this window."

The risk assessment program running in the Rome IV computer sends her a warning. "Are you sure? This will move all crawlers to one location. An accident may cause the loss of Huey, Louise, and Dewey." Rome IV, like Jim, doesn't approve of Ellen's increasingly risky approach.

> A year before the Rome IV exited earth orbit, Jim had arranged for Charlie to be at his grandmother's for the evening; she assumed this would be a romantic dinner. But no...
>
> "Ellen, this family can't survive your trip," said Jim.
>
> "My job..." she started.
>
> "Yes, your job asks a lot - of all three of us. And that means you need to try even harder with Charlie and I," Jim said. He picked at his spaghetti. "You like challenges. We are the most meaningful challenge you will ever have."
>
> "This is unfair," she said. "You get to do what you want. If we want this expensive school for Charlie and you want to start your business, then we need my income. That income results from my job, which you are asking me to give up."
>
> Jim left the table. Ellen left the Earth.

"I confirm my request," says Ellen. Again, the smart thing would be to include this as part of the maintenance to be performed later today. For the briefest of moments, she is aware of making a commitment on behalf of the entire project and crew.

"I will arrive in fifteen minutes," Dewey pipes up. The juvenile voice synthesizes enthusiasm. Some engineer back on earth must be proud of this little tweak to an otherwise dry programming request.

> This morning's video was almost a replay of an earthbound argument.
>
> "Dad won't let me," cries Charlie. When Ellen is home, Charlie will go to her in hopes of a preferable decision. It puts friction between Jim and Ellen. More friction in an already grinding relationship.
>
> "Go ahead," Ellen agrees. "Barefoot is fine."
>
> There is no winning. Jim is vexed, Charlie is sobbing, she is provoked. She makes rash, uncharacteristic decisions.

"I have arrived," says Dewey. This crawler is right next to the MDM and could easily open the panel; Ellen instead starts work on Louise.

"Huey, mimic my right hand. Dewey, mimic my left hand." Pushing and pulling, she untangles Louise's legs from the anchor point. She pumps the air in celebration of her success: Huey follows the action. *It's so much easier with fewer people in the loop.*

Louise pulls herself forward and away from the other two crawlers. *Forward and away...* she thinks.

"Huey and Dewey, you can return to your bay." Ellen watches the two crawlers wander off. She is alone with Louise.

Reaching towards the MDM moves Louise in that direction. Together, they select the correct tool and open the access panel. She knows what they want to do; Louise knows how to do it.

She pushes the test button; Five cards have green lights, one flickers red. She - Huey - reaches in, grabs the handle on the red board and pulls. The board should slide out, but doesn't.

She reaches towards the red MDM card, grabs it, and pulls with strength. "Come on, dammit! Come out of there."

"The amount of force you are suggesting is greater than this component can withstand," says Louise. It is simply quoting from the big book of subcontractor specifications. Louise will not exceed those specifications, no matter how frustrated Ellen might become. Swearing at Louise will not change its mind.

> It was the last argument before she left.
>
> "I want this for him," Ellen says. She is standing in the kitchen, arms crossed, staring down at Jim. "I want Charlie to explore, to do things that might hurt him. How else will he find his limits? How else will he find his passions?"
>
> "Finding your passions is different than self-destruction," answers Jim. "Or destroying your relationships." Jim stops with these words and stares back at Ellen.

Ellen closes the access panel. "Louise, retrieve the entire MDM. Bring it to the maintenance airlock. Please let me know when you have arrived."

Louise slowly does the job. Ellen watches; Louise is deliberate. It was Ellen's impatience that snarled Louise's legs. If she had followed the deliberate path, this wouldn't have been a problem.

> "We need to fix this," Ellen said after a moment's consideration.
>
> "This isn't a fix," replied Jim. "Charlie is on a journey. We're on a journey. It's going to take a long time. It's going to take work."

Ellen decided she was ready for the tedious maintenance.
