Venus is a beautiful planet.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Too bad about the Rome IV mission. Everyone was "super-excited" about Venus and opposition orbits until a solar flare burned out the electronics and killed almost the entire crew. I'm one of the "almost" of "the entire crew" - Kaniela Nakamura - Mission Specialist on Rome IV, now Commander of Aeneas Station. Some of us survived the radiation, the electronics burnout, the darkness, the quiet. Not the smell of death - that's easy to avoid. Just lock the dead crew in the inoperable part of the ship, hand-pump the atmosphere to the command pod and get to building a radio from spitballs and old circuits.

# Rome IV

**Rome IV** ( DATE ) was the third manned mission to Venus in the privately-owned Barsoom project. It's mission was to release Aeneas Station, a science platform floating 52 km above the surface of Venus. On ( DATE ) a class ??? solar flare overloaded the experimental projected radiation shield and irradiated the crew of Rome IV, killing four of the five members. Kaniela Nakamura, the research specialist aboard *Rome IV* survived by sheltering in the hydroponics laboratory.

The radiation from the flare burned out all electronics. Nakamura survived by improvising a heater and life support systems, but remained in darkness while waiting three months for a rescue mission.

Astronauts aboard Rome IV included:

-   Kaniela Nakamura - Research Specialist, training to become Mission Commander. Assumed command of Rome IV when Dietrich died of radiation poisoning. Nakamura is the only survivor of the Rome IV incident.

-   Louie Neuman - Engineering, Communications, and Maintenance

-   Ellen Dietrich - Command

-   Millie Toussaint - Navigation

-   Mark Bixby - Medical
