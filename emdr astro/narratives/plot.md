Mars had a colony by 2050, but it was ten years before it became a viable commercial enterprise.

There is value in Elgoresyte - a fancy type of talcum powder used in geriatric bone replacement and fuel refinement - both big industries. Mars has tourism for thrill-seekers looking for the most extreme conditions. Most important, the Bradbury launch pad points at Sol's outer planets.

But getting to Mars is a bitch. Do it the hard way - "directly" via conjunction - it takes eighteen months. No return for twenty-six months. You'll need to bring lots of fuel and money.

Or do it the easy way - via opposition. Launch windows happen every nineteen months. And it's possible to return one month after arriving. If you need to bail out of the entire trip, opposition provides an early exit. All you need is a planet to swing around - conveniently provided by Venus. Aim for the backside of Venus, then slingshot around the sun-side and bullet on to Mars for a fraction of the fuel and time. You can imagine the off-color jokes about the backside of Venus.

Too bad about the Rome IV mission. Everyone was "super-excited" about Venus and opposition orbits until a solar flare burned out the electronics and killed almost the entire crew. I'm one of the "almost" of "the entire crew" - Kaniela Nakamura - Mission Specialist on Rome IV, now Commander of Aeneas Station. Some of us survived the radiation, the electronics burnout, the darkness, the quiet. Not the smell of death - that's easy to avoid. Just lock the dead crew in the inoperable part of the ship, hand-pump the atmosphere to the command pod and get to building a radio from spitballs and old circuits.

It's a dichotomy how much the public will spend on dramatic edge-cases and how little they will spend on mitigation. We warranted a lavish rescue. The millions on Earth dying from heart attacks, diabetes, and cancer - no such lavish rescue.

The slingshot around Venus made Mars doable. Rome IV gave Venus a bad name, and that made Mars problematic. That made stock in Mars, Inc. plummet. Now we're talking real money; the Venus-Mars thing needed fixing.

No amount of social media could overwrite the pirate videos of the back rooms of Rome IV. A drone-flyer managed to cut a hole in the hull and insert a camera. Tacky, tasteless, and profitable. The video swims through a sunken ship, but the dead crew is still intact. They float, obeying Brownian motion. It's peaceful, except for the radiation burns. Missing is the vomit, crying, and terror.

Those of us who survived were in the hydroponics lab, surrounded by a womb of water. The primary - electronic- shielding overloaded and failed. Outside of the hydroponics lab, death was in days; We cleaned up the bio spills.

How do you get everyone back in the saddle? How do you erase Rome IV? We won't forget, but for everyone else - you have to lead. Demonstrate how safe everything is. Nothing to see here - just the same old, same old. Solar flares? More likely to die from sharks or lightning. See? The water's fine.

They paid us a lot to go back to Venus. A lot. They figure five years of public confidence will set things to right. We'll float around Venus for five years, after which we're good. We're already building a spiffy house on the Iceland tundra. Plenty of rooms for the survivors of Rome IV.

Our main job - our only job - is to provide a reassuring voice to any slingshotters. Our secondary job is to be alive and remind Earth of that continued fact. When we get bored, we do science on Venus; sending probes down to the surface, bring them back before they get crushed, pull them into the garage, replace mangled or crushed parts. Our media group on Earth is three times larger than our engineering group. You can deduce the budget items for engineering versus outreach. Which makes sense; the real money is on Mars, not Venus.

That's not to say Venus is some sort of bargain-basement space operation. It's pricey keeping meat alive in space. Pressure, temperature, gases, food, the right types and amounts of radiation. Life that evolve on earth is persnickety about all of that. Aeneas station does a good job keeping all those items in line.

But there are conditions to this arrangement with Venus. We float at 52 kilometers above the surface. If we rise, we die. If we sink, we die. Floating is life. Floating is hard.

Venus plays a game with this platform. The game is "Let's Kill Kaniela and all his friends." The rules are simple: If everything works, we live. If something fails, then it's Venus 1, Kaniela 0. Venus gets as many turns as it wants. We don't.

Aeneas Station is expensive. Hard launch all the parts to orbit. Robots build the ship. Soft launch us to orbit. We fly the ship. Actually, we made sure the ship flew the ship. And "fly" is a misnomer, there isn't any flight without atmosphere. It's accurate to say we fell towards Venus. It's actually better to say we "spun" towards Venus, since it's rotational motion that got us here. Thank you physics, for being so predictable.

The surface of Venus takes 243 days to rotate. We float in the atmosphere and go around the planet every four days. Fifty-two kilometers is a comfy Earth-like temperature with access to water vapor and oxygen. From this orbit, we talk with Earth every two days for two days, then slip to the night side for two days of quiet time.

Between the surface and the atmosphere are tides and gravity and rotation and temperature. Venus melts lead at its surface. If we landed on planet surface and didn't melt, we could to talk with earth for 121 days, which would be mostly us screaming in pain. Then we'd slip to the night side with no oxygen and no earth and that would be death. So let's not do that.

But enough about me. Let's take a tour of Aeneas and meet the crew.

First is Dr. Xi Wang, our flight surgeon. His place is the medical bay, which isn't much more than a tele-medicine tube and first-aid supplies. Dr. Wang doesn't like us to use that stuff without consulting him first.

Next, say hello to Ellen Dietrich. Ellen does planetary research by dropping expensive toys to the surface then trying to get them back up before they are crushed/burned/blown away/fall in a hole.
