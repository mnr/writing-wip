Mars had a colony by 2050, but it was ten years before it became a viable commercial enterprise.

There is value in Elgoresyte - a fancy type of talcum powder used in geriatric bone replacement and fuel refinement - both big industries. Mars has tourism for thrill-seekers looking for the most extreme conditions. Most important, the Bradbury launch pad points at Sol's outer planets.

But getting to Mars is a bitch. Do it the hard way - "directly" via conjunction - it takes eighteen months. No return for twenty-six months. You'll need to bring lots of fuel and money.

Or do it the easy way - via opposition. Launch windows happen every nineteen months. And it's possible to return one month after arriving. If you need to bail out of the entire trip, opposition provides an early exit. All you need is a planet to swing around - conveniently provided by Venus. Aim for the backside of Venus, then slingshot around the sun-side and bullet on to Mars for a fraction of the fuel and time.

Too bad about the Rome IV mission. Everyone was "super-excited" about Venus and opposition orbits until a solar flare burned out the electronics and killed almost the entire crew. I'm one of the "almost" of "the entire crew" - Kaniela Nakamura - Mission Specialist on Rome IV, now Commander of Aeneas Station. Some of us survived the radiation, the electronics burnout, the darkness, the quiet. Not the smell of death - that's easy to avoid. Just lock the dead crew in the inoperable part of the ship, hand-pump the atmosphere to the command pod and get to building a radio from spitballs and old circuits.

It's a dichotomy how much the public will spend on dramatic edge-cases and how little they will spend on mitigation. We warranted a lavish rescue. The millions on Earth dying from heart attacks, diabetes, and cancer - no such lavish rescue.

The slingshot around Venus made Mars doable. Rome IV gave Venus a bad name, and that made Mars problematic. That made stock in Mars, Inc. plummet. Now we're talking real money; the Venus-Mars thing needed fixing.

No amount of social media could overwrite the pirate videos of the back rooms of Rome IV. A drone-flyer managed to cut a hole in the hull and insert a camera. Tacky, tasteless, and profitable. The video swims through a sunken ship, but the dead crew is still intact. They float, obeying Brownian motion. It's peaceful, except for the radiation burns. Missing is the vomit, crying, and terror.

Those of us who survived were in the hydroponics lab, surrounded by a womb of water. The primary - electronic- shielding overloaded and failed. Outside of the hydroponics lab, death was in days; We cleaned up the bio spills.

How do you get everyone back in the saddle? How do you erase Rome IV? We won't forget, but for everyone else - you have to lead. Demonstrate how safe everything is. Nothing to see here - just the same old, same old. Solar flares? More likely to die from sharks or lightning. See? The water's fine.

They paid us a lot to go back to Venus. A lot. They figure five years of public confidence will set things to right. We'll float around Venus for five years, after which we're good. We're already building a spiffy house on the Iceland tundra. Plenty of rooms for the survivors of Rome IV.

Our main job - our only job - is to provide a reassuring voice to any slingshotters. Our secondary job is to be alive and remind Earth of that continued fact. When we get bored, we do science on Venus; sending probes down to the surface, bring them back before they get crushed, pull them into the garage, replace mangled or crushed parts. Our media group on Earth is three times larger than our engineering group. You can deduce the budget items for engineering versus outreach. Which makes sense; the real money is on Mars, not Venus.
