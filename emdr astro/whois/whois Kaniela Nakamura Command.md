The main character. The "front" of the collective.

Kaniela was the research specialist aboard *Rome IV* , a mission to orbit Venus. *Rome IV* was to make a flyby and drop of resources to be used for the Venus floating station, but suffered massive electronics blackout due to a solar flare.

Of the five astronauts aboard, only Kaniela returned to Earth, the rest of the crew dying of massive radiation burns and life support failures. Kaniela had been in the hydroponics lab when the flare erupted - the water in the walls shielded him from the radiation.

Rome IV's electronics were burned out, leaving it dead in orbit above Venus. Kaniela spent months with a dying crew - then a dead crew. Then a dark ship with no communication. The only communication was the rescue ship pounding on the airlock.

Kaniela is a disassociative personality and believes the other Rome IV astronauts made it back. These are Kaniela's alters. Kaniela is the front, but isn't aware they are alters. Kaniela IS AWARE of their presence, but assumes they never meet because they are in separate wings of the ship.

The alters have remained viable and re-learned their roles. Mission control is uneasy about this arrangement, but doesn't have the resources to send an entire crew to Venus. Kaniela is eager to return, so a Faustian deal is reached.
