Naolin is mission control. Need to find out who talks to astronauts. [Capcom](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/what-is-capcom).

1.  CAPCOM's job is to listen to all of the information about the mission from every console in the room, hear what the Flight Director wants the crew to know, and then turn it into words the crew will understand, and decide when best to tell them. 

2.  CAPCOM is also the crew's trusted agent on the ground, to fight battles and argue in their stead. This role is normally filled by an experienced astronaut or someone who works closely with the astronauts since they are familiar with vehicle systems, control systems, flight dynamics, and life support readings aboard the spacecraft. 

3.  On rare occasions, someone other than CAPCOM can address the crew. During the Gemini 4 mission, Flight Director Chris Kraft directly commanded United States astronaut Ed White to end his spacewalk, fearing that continuing the spacewalk would be unsafe.
