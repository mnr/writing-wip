Pronounce: Doctor Hsi Wong

Dr. Xi Wang was flight surgeon aboard Rome IV and perished from radiation exposure. He is also an alter of Kaniela Nakamura aboard Aeneas, occupying his original position as flight surgeon.

Because the crew couldn't pronounce his name correctly - "Hsi Wong" - he requested they refer to him as "Dee Wang" - short for Doctor Wang. D'Wang often teases the crew by mispronouncing their names in a similar fashion. *Kaniel Nakamura* becomes *Kaynack. Kyle Neuman* becomes *Ki-new*.

Dr. Wang originally trained as a general surgeon, then specialized in robotic and AI telemedicine.
