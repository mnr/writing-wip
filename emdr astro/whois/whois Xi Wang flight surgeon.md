## **Narrative:**

Dr. Xi Wang was flight surgeon aboard Rome IV and perished from radiation exposure. He is also an alter of Kaniela Nakamura aboard Aeneas, occupying his original position as flight surgeon.

Dr. Wang originally trained as a general surgeon, then specialized in robotic and AI telemedicine.

He enjoys playing Jazz on his [roll-up piano](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WZD8BM9/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_HYCVY1KPA57FGGXWFFH1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1) - but he's an eternal beginner and makes the exact same mistake in each piece every time he plays it, then stops, corrects the mistake, and then restarts. He has a small repertoire - four songs: Autumn Leaves, All of Me, Take Five, and Linus and Lucy.

In spite of his piano torture, Dr. Wang is popular and trusted among the crew. Everyone is comfortable talking to him about issues in their lives.

## **Myers-Briggs**

An **Executive ([ESTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/estj-personality))** is someone with the [Extraverted](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/mind-introverted-vs-extraverted), [Observant](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/energy-intuitive-vs-observant), [Thinking](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/nature-thinking-vs-feeling), and [Judging](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/tactics-judging-vs-prospecting) personality traits. They possess great fortitude, emphatically following their own sensible judgment. They often serve as a stabilizing force among others, able to offer solid direction amid adversity.

Executives are representatives of tradition and order, utilizing their understanding of what is right, wrong and socially acceptable to bring families and communities together. Embracing the values of honesty, dedication and dignity, people with the Executive personality type are valued for their clear advice and guidance, and they happily lead the way on difficult paths. Taking pride in bringing people together, Executives often take on roles as community organizers, working hard to bring everyone together in celebration of cherished local events, or in defense of the traditional values that hold families and communities together.

Few personality types are as practical and strong-willed as Executives. Known for their reliability and administrative skills, Executives are good at creating and maintaining a secure and stable environment for themselves and their loved ones. Executives' dedication is invaluable in many areas, including their own personal growth.

Yet Executives can be easily tripped up in areas where their rational and practical approach is more of a liability than an asset. Whether it is finding (or keeping) a partner, learning to relax or improvise, reaching dazzling heights on the career ladder, or managing their workload, Executives need to put in a conscious effort to develop their weaker traits and additional skills.
