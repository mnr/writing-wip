**Narrative:**

Dr. Xi Wang was flight surgeon aboard Rome IV and perished from radiation exposure. He is also an alter of Kaniela Nakamura aboard Aeneas, occupying his original position as flight surgeon.

Dr. Wang originally trained as a general surgeon, then specialized in robotic and AI telemedicine.

He enjoys playing Jazz on his [roll-up piano](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WZD8BM9/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_HYCVY1KPA57FGGXWFFH1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1) - but he's an eternal beginner and makes the exact same mistake in each piece every time he plays it, then stops, corrects the mistake, and then restarts. He has a small repertoire - four songs: Autumn Leaves, All of Me, Take Five, and Linus and Lucy.

In spite of his piano torture, Dr. Wang is popular and trusted among the crew. Everyone is comfortable talking to him about issues in their lives.
