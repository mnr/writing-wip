**Rome IV** ( DATE ) was the third manned mission to Venus in the privately-owned Barsoom project. It's mission was to release Aeneas Station, a science platform floating 52 km above the surface of Venus. On ( DATE ) a class ??? solar flare overloaded the experimental projected radiation shield and irradiated the crew of Rome IV, killing four of the five members. Kaniela Nakamura, the research specialist aboard *Rome IV* survived by sheltering in the hydroponics laboratory.

The radiation from the flare burned out all electronics. Nakamura survived by improvising a heater and life support systems, but remained in darkness while waiting three months for a rescue mission.

Rome IV's electronics were burned out, leaving it dead in orbit above Venus. Kaniela spent months with a dying crew - then a dead crew. Then a dark ship with no communication. The only communication was the rescue ship pounding on the airlock.

Rome IV consists of two parts: the CSM (Command and Service Module) and the VOM (Venus Orbiter Module). The VOM will become Aeneas Station. Slang references to the VOM are the VOMit COMET or VeeCee.

Aeneas has voice control. There is a keyboard control panel - with monitor - in the Engineering room.

Aeneas has three hull crawlers: Huey (male adult voice), Dewey (juvenile male voice), and Lou (female voice). They are discussed at length in "day in the life of: ditlo dietrich.md"
