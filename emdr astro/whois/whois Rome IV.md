# Rome IV

**Rome IV** ( DATE ) was the third manned mission to Venus in the privately-owned Barsoom project. It's mission was to release Aeneas Station, a science platform floating 52 km above the surface of Venus. On ( DATE ) a class ??? solar flare overloaded the experimental projected radiation shield and irradiated the crew of Rome IV, killing four of the five members. Kaniela Nakamura, the research specialist aboard *Rome IV* survived by sheltering in the hydroponics laboratory.

The radiation from the flare burned out all electronics. Nakamura survived by improvising a heater and life support systems, but remained in darkness while waiting three months for a rescue mission.

Rome IV's electronics were burned out, leaving it dead in orbit above Venus. Kaniela spent months with a dying crew - then a dead crew. Then a dark ship with no communication. The only communication was the rescue ship pounding on the airlock.

Astronauts aboard Rome IV included:

-   Kaniela Nakamura - Research Specialist, training to become Mission Commander. Assumed command of Rome IV when Dietrich died of radiation poisoning. Nakamura is the only survivor of the Rome IV incident.

-   Louie Neuman - Engineering, Communications, and Maintenance
