# Rome IV

**Rome IV** ( DATE ) was the third manned mission to Venus in the privately-owned Barsoom project. It's mission was to build and release the floating platform to be used for the Aeneas Station. On ( DATE ) a class ??? solar flare overloaded the experimental projected radiation shield and irradiated the crew of Rome IV, killing four of the five members. Kaniela Nakamura, the research specialist aboard *Rome IV* survived by sheltering in the hydroponics laboratory.

The radiation from the flare also burned out all electronics. Kaniela survived by improvising a heater and life support systems, but remain in darkness for three months while a rescue mission was sent.

Mars had a colony by 2050, but it was ten years before it became a viable commercial enterprise.

Or do it the easy way - via opposition. Launch windows happen every nineteen months. And it's possible to return one month after arriving. If you need to bail out of the entire trip, opposition provides an early exit. All you need is a planet to swing around - conveniently provided by Venus. Aim for the backside of Venus, then slingshot around the sun-side and bullet on to Mars for a fraction of the fuel and time. You can imagine the off-color jokes about the backside of Venus.

to orbit Venus in preparation for the creation of a long-term orbiting platform.

Kaniela was training to be a mission commander when they experienced a series of cataclysmic events, producing PTSD and DID. This happened aboard Rome IV , a mission to orbit Venus. Rome IV was to make a flyby and drop of resources to be used for the Venus floating station, but suffered massive electronics blackout due to a solar flare.

Of the five astronauts aboard, only Kaniela returned to Earth, the rest of the crew dying of massive radiation burns and life support failures. Kaniela had been in the hydroponics lab when the flare erupted - the water in the walls shielded him from the radiation.

Rome IV's electronics were burned out, leaving it dead in orbit above Venus. Kaniela spent months with a dying crew - then a dead crew. Then a dark ship with no communication. The only communication was the rescue ship pounding on the airlock.

Too bad about the Rome IV mission. Everyone was "super-excited" about Venus and opposition orbits until a solar flare burned out the electronics and killed almost the entire crew. I'm one of the "almost" of "the entire crew" - Kaniela Nakamura - Mission Specialist on Rome IV, now Commander of Aeneas Station. Some of us survived the radiation, the electronics burnout, the darkness, the quiet. Not the smell of death - that's easy to avoid. Just lock the dead crew in the inoperable part of the ship, hand-pump the atmosphere to the command pod and get to building a radio from spitballs and old circuits.
