## Myers-Briggs:

A **Campaigner ([ENFP](https://www.16personalities.com/enfp-personality))** is someone with the [Extraverted](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/mind-introverted-vs-extraverted), [Intuitive](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/energy-intuitive-vs-observant), [Feeling](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/nature-thinking-vs-feeling), and [Prospecting](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/tactics-judging-vs-prospecting) personality traits. These people tend to embrace big ideas and actions that reflect their sense of hope and goodwill toward others. Their vibrant energy can flow in many directions.

Few personality types are as creative and charismatic as Campaigners (ENFPs). Known for their idealism and enthusiasm, these personalities excel at dealing with unexpected challenges and brightening the lives of those around them.

Yet Campaigners can be tripped up in certain areas of their lives. When it comes to building relationships, choosing a career, or turning their dreams into reality, people with this personality type may need to consciously address their weaknesses and gain new skills -- even as they draw on their many strengths.

## Other:

1.  CAPCOM's job is to listen to all of the information about the mission from every console in the room, hear what the Flight Director wants the crew to know, and then turn it into words the crew will understand, and decide when best to tell them. 

2.  CAPCOM is also the crew's trusted agent on the ground, to fight battles and argue in their stead. This role is normally filled by an experienced astronaut or someone who works closely with the astronauts since they are familiar with vehicle systems, control systems, flight dynamics, and life support readings aboard the spacecraft. 

3.  On rare occasions, someone other than CAPCOM can address the crew. During the Gemini 4 mission, Flight Director Chris Kraft directly commanded United States astronaut Ed White to end his spacewalk, fearing that continuing the spacewalk would be unsafe.
