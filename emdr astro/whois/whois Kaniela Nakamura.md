# Kaniela Nakamura

The main character. The "front" of the collective.

Kaniela was training to be a mission commander when they experienced a series of cataclysmic events, producing PTSD and DID. This happened aboard *Rome IV* , a mission to orbit Venus. *Rome IV*![]() was to make a flyby and drop of resources to be used for the Venus floating station, but suffered massive electronics blackout due to a solar flare. Of the five astronauts aboard, only Kaniela returned to Earth, the rest of the crew dying of massive radiation burns and life support failures.

*Rome IV* dropped all resources but in unstable orbits, creating a time crunch to return to Venus to complete the station and return it to stable elevation.

Kaniela is a dissociative personality, consisting of...

-   *Sparky* - Handles engineering, communications, and maintenance.

-   ??? - Controls landers on Venus surface. i.e. payload specialist & science officer

-   ??? - Medical

-   *Kaniela Nakamura* - Mission command
