**Pronounce**: kile NEW-man

## Narrative

*aka Sparky* - Handles engineering, communications, and maintenance.

Kyle has extensive experience building electronic circuits and improvising fixes when things go wrong. When faced with a challenge, he is persistent and simply won't quit until it is solved. He is not so interested in routine maintenance, hates doing routine system checks unless it reveals something he gets to repair.

His private room is in a constant state of disassembly. Monitors are often pulled out of wall mounts - or replaced later on. Panels are open, exposing connectors. Any wall panel with a lock is unlocked, slightly ajar, and often with wires snaking out to other panels.

"That wasn't working right," is a trademark phrase. He usually points or nods to an open panel or improvised connection job. He is fixated on the predictive systems driving the EVA telepresence robots, allowing them to assist the internal spacecraft operator. As a result, at least one (or the other) of the telepresence robots are partly disassembled and running diagnostics, or assembled and running a test sequence.

Kyle is persuasive - sometimes to the point of annoying and combative. He often argues the technical advantages of a solution at the expense of emotional costs or any deference to the feelings of his shipmates. He often debates command decisions - sometimes just for the sake of disagreeing/debating. His brainstorming, debate and over-analysis drives his task-oriented colleagues crazy

Kyle has had several romantic relationships, but all have ended. "I drove them a bit crazy," he says. "They weren't willing to become their best selves and I finally gave up helping them improve."

Kyle is the opposite of an empath - although not "on the Asperger spectrum."

Kyle is interested in Ellen Dietrich's photography, but his own photography is much more abstract. He constantly tries to debate photography with Ellen - but she isn't interested in continuing the conversation.

They tend to be bold and creative, deconstructing and rebuilding ideas with great mental agility. They pursue their goals vigorously despite any resistance they might encounter.

Armed with a powerful intellect and vivid imagination, Debaters can overcome or outmaneuver obstacles that seem unbeatable to most. At the same time, their many quirks, such as often unconstrained rationalism, lead to many misunderstandings.Â
