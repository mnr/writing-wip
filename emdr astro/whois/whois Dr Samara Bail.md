**Narrative:**

Dr. Samara Bail is an interactive and AI-powered journal writing assistant whose purpose is to help the human crew create effective personal logs of daily experiences. She does not exist in meat-space, only virtually. Research indicates the best human journals are a result of guided interviews, rather than free-form recall.

Based on [ELIZA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA), Dr. Bail doesn't simply parrot questions. It uses [sentiment analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis) to evaluate tone, intent, and emotion. Humans readily anthropomorphize Dr. Bail, even when they know she is a computer program.

Dr. Bail is aware of the status of mechanical and computer systems, as well as biometrics on the crew. She uses that information to create questions for a daily interview, providing a human context to the technical situation.

She is modeled after Nupur Dhakephalkar, a consultant to the development team. Dr. Dhakephalkar trained at the apex center for mental health and neuroscience education -- NIMHANS (The National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences) and has a PhD. in Clinical Psychology from SPPU. She has completed a double bachelors, masters, and M.Phil. in Clinical Psychology and a diploma in Clinical Hypnotherapy.

Her intense work experience of over 8 years in Clinical Psychology gives her an edge in psychological testing and psychotherapy. Nupur also has invaluable skills in psycho-oncology and perinatal psychology having had a good hands-on experience in the same. She has a special interest in adolescent, adult psychotherapy, and Family therapy. Few of the key services she is well known for are -- psychotherapy for Depression, Anxiety spectrum disorders, Obsessive Compulsive disorders, personality disorders among others.

Nupur is a Registered Clinical Psychologist with the Rehabilitation Council of India (RCI) (CRR no A57038). She is also a professional life member of the Indian Association of Clinical Psychologists (IACP) (PLM-585/16/18).

**Dialog From Wolet No Kimi**

The monitor shows a seated woman with a name banner: Dr. Sarama Bail. She wears a professional Sari and a red spot between her eyes. As I enter, she turns to face me.

"Are you artificial intelligence?" I ask. "Would it bother you if I were?" she responds. Dr. Bail looks amused.

"Is she artificial intelligence?" "Would it bother you if she was? Perhaps you should ask her." Dr. Bail is still on the split screen and watches us discuss her in the third person. "I'm sitting right here, and I can hear you," Dr. Bail answers.

"How does this make you feel?" she asks.

"How can I convince you if I'm real or artificial?" Dr. Bail asks. I'm irritable and can't help testing her Turing limits. "Show me your code. If you won't comply, then you might be real. If you do comply, then you're artificial." I give her a difficult command to parse out. It isn't important if she shows me code, just how she responds. To my surprise, she shows me pages of computer algorithms. She proves she is artificial, but in a fashion that indicates she might be real. What if she is real, but lying with fake code? An interesting conundrum.
