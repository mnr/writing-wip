# Aeneas 

![*Aeneas is the son of Venus in Greek mythology.*](https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/141222115103-cloud-city.png){width="471"}

**Pronounce**: uh·**nee**·uhs

## Narrative

Aeneas consists of two parts: the CSM (Command and Service Module) and the VOM (Venus Orbiter Module). Slang references to the VOM are the VOMit COMET or VeeCee.

Aeneas VOM floats 52 km above Venus from a balloon of breathable air. It is designed for a minimal crew (of one, as we find out later).

It's mission is to communicate with ships on a Mars-bound slingshot around the backside of Venus.

Aeneas has voice control. There is a keyboard control panel - with monitor - in the Engineering room.

Aeneas has three hull crawlers: Huey (male adult voice), Dewey (juvenile male voice), and Lou (female voice). They are discussed at length in "day in the life of: ditlo dietrich.md"
