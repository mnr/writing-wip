## Narrative

Aeneas Station floats 52 km above Venus from a balloon of breathable air. It is designed for a minimal crew (of one, as we find out later).

It's mission is to communicate with ships on a Mars-bound slingshot around the backside of Venus.

Aeneas has voice control. There is a keyboard control panel - with monitor - in the Engineering room.
