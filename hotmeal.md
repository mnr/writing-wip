# Hot Meal

Detective Araci Belo admires the view of post-earthquake Portland from this small condominium. The west hills provide a lush green background to the dense housing towers, interconnected by skyways and hypertube stations. 

He considers the shattered condo he stands in. The explosion had propelled bits of the oven from the back of the condo, spraying shrapnel towards the window. A sweet, meaty smell of burnt flesh emanates from Dakota Williams, the recently deceased occupant of the condominium. She lies in the middle of the room; her severed right arm near the earthquake pillar. Her left forearm leans against the wall. The explosion burned through her clothing, face, and skin.

Pieces of meal boxes are scattered around. How many is difficult to know; metal and plastic shards are mixed with uncooked food. One is in the far corner, complete except for a dented top. The cube, small enough to hold in both hands, is covered with a bright depiction of the traditional (soy-based) steak and potatoes with Brussels sprouts.  

Araci steps around Dakota and through the door to the other half of the condominium containing a bedroom and bath. The bathroom is tidy, but not spotless. There are two toothbrushes in a cup and enough towels for a couple. The bedroom has a desk cluttered with electronic parts. The bed is neat; the floor picked up except for a few kitchen utensils thrown in by the explosion.

“The scan is ready,” says Officer Guadalupe Reyes, one of the many people swarming the condominium. She pushes a  button on a hand-held terminal. “I’ve put the render in the report folder. You interested in grabbing some dinner tonight?” 

*Guadalupe* - sometimes “Lupe” - is Araci’s sparring partner in the Portland Police self-defense class. Their relationship is professional, although there are signals something more might be possible. 

“Sure. Six pm?” replies Araci. “Come to my place and I’ll make you a meal that doesn’t explode.”

“You are such a buzzkill. I was hoping for excitement.” She grabs her bags and pushes through the crowd. “See you tonight.”

Araci reviews the scan in his visor and compares two overlaid views; the real, burned room, and the original as shown in the floorplan. An augmented reality outline fills in the missing parts of the destroyed oven. It was a countertop unit and all that remains is the back panel and fuel tank. Everything splays outwards from where the oven used to be; the explosion had clearly occurred there.  

Araci retrieves the steak and potatoes meal from the corner of the main room and wonders if it’s broken. He can’t afford one of the expensive Hestia ovens; instead he boils food packets like every other middle-class American. Araci turns the meal box over, shakes it, puts it down. Normally, Hestia food boxes and ovens produce a perfect dinner. This time, Hestia took an angry turn for the worse.

Lupe’s scan allows for an animated reconstruction of the explosion, tracing the path of the scattered parts back to their original assembly. Araci plays it forward and reverse three times. What happened is clear. Dakota had been standing in front of the oven when it exploded and distributed a high-velocity cloud of sharp plastic, metal, and glass through her and into the room.

As for this condo, there was nothing more. He ships the report to the Portland Police server and leaves the apartment clean-up to the forensics team.

Araci Belo loves being a police detective. He looks young for a middle-age guy; Lupe finds him attractive. She appreciates his stability and satisfaction with his life; both things she is in search of for herself. She stands near the kitchen counter with a glass of wine, watching him fuss with the presentation.

Araci assembles Chicken Piccata, one of the more complex meals available in pouches. He enjoys cooking, the reveal of ingredients from each foil bag, the simple preparation, the assembly. He isn’t dedicated enough to work from raw foods, pre-measured packets is his limit. Still - the *smell* of onions when they emerge from the saute packet. Squeezing lemon slices on the chicken. Sprinkling capers, salt, and pepper just before plating. 

Building a meal from scratch would be even better, but grocery stores in his neighborhood removed their coolers and freezers long ago. The logistics of a foil packet are much simpler than transporting fresh vegetables or meat.

“You should buy one of those ovens,” observes Lupe. “You like cooking. You could make more complex meals.”

“I considered it, but after today, I’m not so sure.” Araci moves the two plates to the table, refills both wine glasses, and invites Lupe. “I’ve seen the advertisements. Push the meal box into the oven and stand back. Where’s the romance?”

“Maybe not romance, but how would you print a steak without one?”

“Print steak how?” asks Araci? “You can’t do that at home.”

“Right. Not with a packet boiler,” says Lupe. This isn’t her first glass of wine and she’s feeling chatty. “That’s the big deal with a Hestia oven. When you insert a meal into the oven, it engages with electricity, a data port and a gas port. The gas flows into chambers in the meal box. The meal box controls the addition of ingredients and supervises printing any meat. The oven connects the meal to the outside world. The entire setup is patented.”

“So there’s a meat printer in the meal box?”

“I know! It doesn’t seem like there’s enough room. But the meal opens a valve, meat paste pours out, the oven cooks it, another layer of meat paste, some flavors, more cook. Pretty soon you have a New York steak. Can’t do that with foil packets.”

“I did not know,” admits Araci. He looks suspiciously at the chicken on his fork. “But here’s a question; why gas? Why not just heat with electricity?”

“Good question,” replies Lupe. She’s talkative. “Hestia can’t charge for electricity, but they can sell you overpriced gas canisters. You can’t refill a Hestia tank; you have to buy a new one. Like ink for printers; Buy it from the manufacturer or they won’t work.”

“I get it,” says Araci. He accepts the chicken for what it is and takes another bite. “Are you up for ice cream? I bought a tube of cherry chunk.”

// ---

Araci’s day starts with a call to Hestia, the center of suspicion. His call is met with an artificially intelligent receptionist, projected through his visor as though sitting across from him at the desk. 

“Hello Araci Belo,” says the receptionist. It wasn’t surprising she knew his name, he was easy to identify from his online presence. “I’m here to help.” The AI exhibits artificial signs of life; her eyes blink, she breathes; but waits, saying nothing more.

“I’d like to speak to the Hestia Product Manager,” replies Araci. 

The receptionist doesn’t hesitate. “I’m sorry, but our product managers are only available by appointment. Can I connect you with our media spokesperson?”

“No. I’m with the Portland Police Department and I’m working on a case involving your Hestia ovens.” Araci enunciates and speaks slowly, emphasizing the word ‘Police.’

“One minute please.” the receptionist pauses, then fades to black. In their place appears a dark-haired, middle-age man. He looks up and adjusts something on his desk.

“Hello Mr. Belo. My name is Farj Capcin. I’m the product manager for Hestia ovens. I’m told you have some questions.” He waves his hand from off-screen to the center of his view, adding two more individuals. “This is Ms. Broin, our attorney, and Mr. Nilsson, who manages media relations. Since you are a police representative, we are recording this call. Do you object?”

“Feel free.” The prickly reception did not surprise Araci. He’d used his detective status to get the receptionist to act, but knew it would put everyone on guard. 

“I’m investigating the death of Dakota Williams...” 

Araci hasn’t finished speaking, but Broin the attorney immediately searches for something. She taps Farj and points to whatever she found. Farj mutes and gestures to Broin. Nilsson leans in to look at Broin’s display, rubs his balding head and speaks to Farj. He turns to Nilsson, then Broin, confers for a minute, then returns to Araci.

“Dakota Williams is a member of Abundancy. We support the idea of unrestricted food for all and have issued several statements regarding our eagerness to accomplish this within the bounds of our corporation’s abilities.” 

Farj recited this without hesitation. This was not the first time he had to address issues with the Abundancy group. Araci wondered if the AI receptionist knew the line as well.

Abundancy is news to Araci. Pretending to make a note, he opens a search. 

Araci quickly learns Abundancy is an activist group; part Greenpeace, part Free Software Foundation, part Earth First, part Right to Repair. They accuse Hestia of trying to patent food, similar to how DuPont and Monsanto hold patents on genetically-modified corn, soybean, and alfalfa. Abundancy argues Hesti will eventually claim rights to any method of combining food to make a meal. 

Abundancy has protested. They haven’t gone as far as breaking windows at Hestia factories, but they have disrupted shareholder meetings and sent letters just shy of threatening bodily harm. Abundancy lists Dakota as a volunteer, but the search doesn’t describe her responsibilities.

*Wasn’t it strange for Dakota to own a device from the Great Satan Hestia?* thinks Araci.

He returns to the conversation. “I’m more interested in an explosion of one of your devices.”

Farj again mutes and confers, then answers Araci. “We know Ms. Williams owns a Hestia Oven, but that unit has not responded to our status requests for several weeks. She has refused to allow us to provide maintenance, so we aren’t liable.”

“What have you heard about the malfunction?” asks Araci. “Have you determined the cause?”

“We had a team on site and I’m able to supply you with their report,” says Farj. “I suspect you found the same; the oven wasn’t intact, and it was difficult to recover the pieces.”

“So you don’t know what happened?”

“Correct,” answers Farj. “When we do, we’ll be happy to share those findings.”

Araci ends the call. Hestia won’t provide any more information, so it makes little sense to keep asking. He’ll need more details before speaking with them again.

Onwards to his next call.

“Hello, I’m Araci Belo,” he says. The AI fielding calls for Abundancy isn’t impressed; It might even be broken. It is a virtual puppet projected into his room, only showing a gray outline of a humanoid. There is no face and the normal signs of life are missing. 

“I’m investigating the death of Dakota Williams,” Araci says. 

Nothing.

“I can get a search warrant if necessary,” tries Araci. “I can have you audited and put your non-profit status on hold.”

The gray humanoid abruptly gains nuances of life. Its head tracks Araci’s movement; its left hand fidgets. The right moves an unseen control. It speaks.

“Detective Araci, we’re not stupid. Please don’t threaten us with legal action you can’t follow up on,” says whoever is behind the puppet. “However, since you’re investigating what happened to Dakota, I want to make certain you’re aware of all the facts.”

“I recently spoke to Hestia,” states Araci. “They mentioned your organization.”

“I’m sure they did. Hestia is trying to restrict access to food. They built their oven to work with their food - and *only* their food. They control the seed, they control the harvest, they control the preparation. It’s proprietary from field to consumer, locking out anyone who wants to do it themselves. That’s wrong and Abundancy is working to prevent it.”

“But Hestia only controls food boxes and ovens,” says Araci. “They aren’t stopping me from using a boiler and a pouch.”

“Not yet. But boil pouches made fresh food obsolete. Hestia will eventually try to make them obsolete. Then yes, they will stop you from cooking with boiler and pouch.”

“That’s interesting, but I’m mainly concerned about Dakota. What was she working on?”

“Dakota was working on her own time and had an interest in the mechanics of the oven and meal boxes. I suggest you look at the financial impact to Hestia if they were to lose control of their food system. It might be worth killing someone. Not that corporations have ever done anything evil.”

“I appreciate your theories. When you’re ready to speak face to face, please contact me.” Araci ends the call. 

*Would a corporation kill to protect intellectual property? Of course they would.*

Araci’s visor announces a request from Lupe, which he gladly accepts. “Araci, we’re finding some interesting details in the scan of the condominium explosion. It takes some high resolution, come over to the media lab and see.”

// ---

The police media lab isn’t much more than a room with desks and monitors. The striking feature is the glass wall with a view of the servers. Privacy laws require this type of data be under actual lock and key, so Araci has to visit in person.

“We had the render machines spend some quality time with the scans and found this interesting difference.” Lupe displays the condominium scan Araci viewed earlier but in much higher resolution.

“There are two things you should see,” says Lupe. “Let’s start with the oven reconstruction.”

Lupe waves the condo into view, then spreads her hands to enlarge the space where the oven used to be. Spinning her fingers counter-clockwise re-assembles it to its assumed state before the explosion. To the side were two new objects; a circuit board and a meal box.

“Okay, look at this.” Lupe points at the back of the oven. “The scan couldn’t find any pieces of the oven circuit board, so it left that space empty. But look at this circuit to the side - the scan found parts of it all over the room. It was near - or inside - the oven when it exploded. This isn’t the standard Hestia circuit board. Someone installed a home-built version.”

“Can you move to the desk?” asks Araci.

The view steps back from the oven, turns, and glides to the bedroom. When Araci had physically been there, he had seen electronics. They are visible in the render currently being shown, with the addition of tags identifying the parts.

Many of the tags identify stock electronics. The largest circuit is a Hestia board belonging to the oven in the other room. Lupe points it out. “Dakota took this out of the Hestia and installed a home-built version.”

“So Dakota wasn’t using the oven for food. She was doing research. That’s one mystery partially solved,” says Araci. “You mentioned you had two interesting things to show me?” 

“Yes.” She moves the view to the meal box. It’s in bad shape, with large jagged gaps. 

“Look. Right here,” says Lupe. “This serial number on the meal is partially damaged. But it doesn’t correspond to anything available on the open market. We don’t know where she got it.”

“A mystery meal in an altered oven,” says Araci. “Operator error compounded by hackery?” 

“Did you find the missing roommate?” asks Lupe. “Toothbrushes? Towels?”

“I haven’t had time to search Dakota’s timeline in depth. How about now?” Araci taps his visor and speaks a command. “Display Dakota Williams social history.”

Snippets from Dakota’s life appear in Araci’s visor; he shares them with Lupe. In a video dated January 2059, a man named Robin Lopez first appears. The videos of Dakota and Robin become playful, then intimate, leading up to their move to the condo.

A quick search for Robin Lopez shows he also works for Abundancy. He is the author of ‘The Road To Food Free From Restrictions.’ and Hestia is his nemesis.

“So if they were both with Abundancy and fighting with Hestia, why did they have one of the ovens? Maybe Hestia didn’t like what she was doing?” suggests Lupe. “They have all sorts of control over that thing. Can they tell it to explode?”

“Or… maybe Robin didn’t like something Dakota was doing?” adds Araci. “I wonder where he is?” 

// ---

Araci’s last task of the day is to notify next of kin. Of course, Dakota’s family has already heard about her death. It’s impossible for Araci to be the point of first contact when everything is public to everyone. But visiting the family is the most human part of his job - and the most difficult.

Dakota’s father lives in a studio apartment. Neighbor kids play on the balcony overlooking the urban canyon formed by buildings and streets below. Araci knocks and is greeted by an older man, dressed in a light shirt and shorts. “You must be Detective Belo,” he says. “I’m Archer Williams. Dakota’s father. Please come in.”

“I’m sorry to tell you about your daughter’s death,” replies Araci. “She died from an explosion in her home.”

“I know, and I thank you for your concern. Can I offer you a drink?” Archer mixes powder in water. It fizzes and Araci smells red wine. He accepts the glass and takes a sip to demonstrate his solidarity with Archer. 

“To Dakota,” says Archer. 

“To your daughter,” responds Araci. “Again, I’m sorry.” A moment of respectful silence passes before he speaks again.

“We’re investigating the explosion now. Is there anything we can tell you - or that you would like us to know?”

“Yes, there is.” Archer puts down the glass and crosses his arms. “Dakota was a good engineer. Not brilliant, but decent enough to accomplish what she needed to do. School wasn’t easy for her. She had to struggle to finish that degree. But it taught her to be careful, persistent, and not to assume her initial instinct was correct. Archer chokes up, wipes his eyes. He takes a breath and continues,”That’s why I’m surprised she got caught in an explosion. She didn’t expect things would run the first or second time. So she planned for failure."

“I assume you know she was experimenting with the oven?” asks Araci.

“I don’t know all the details. She didn’t want me to know what she was doing for Abundancy. That is a strange group. Actually, it is a strange boy. I’m certain Abundancy isn’t anything more than Robin Lopez.”

“I’m looking for Robin. I believe he was living with Dakota. But he’s disappeared.”

“That doesn’t surprise me.” Archer picks up the wine and swirls the glass. “Lopez does what he needs to get what he wants. Dakota had a a stable job, and she enjoyed it. Lopez convinced her to work on his Abundancy project instead. Dakota was careful, unless she was with Lopez. Then she moved fast and broke things. Lopez is impulsive, reckless, and coercive. None of those are good qualities.”

“Mr. Williams, if you hear from Robin Lopez, would you tell me?” asks Araci. “And if there is anything else you’d like to learn from me, I’m at your service.”

The sun is setting over the adjoining building when Araci left Archer Williams’ apartment. With a trace more dust in the air, it might look like a wilderness landscape. 

// ---

Araci greets the morning with instant coffee. Normally he boils a pouch of pre-brewed, but today he has things to do. Powder, hot water, drink. Araci opens a call to Hestia. After wrangling with the AI receptionist, Farj Capcin appears.

“I have a few details I’d like to show you, but you’ll want to do this in person,” says Araci. “If you were to get a seat on the hyperloop, you could be here in time for an afternoon conference. Yes?”

“Normally no,” replies Farj. “But I have a light day and I’m intrigued. Are you buying lunch?”

“Sure. I’ll meet you at the counter in the PDX downtown station.”

// ---

Araci pays for lunch with Farj and Nilsson, the marketing guy for Hestia. They catch the light rail to the police media station where Lupe already has the render of the oven displayed and two boxes to the side.

“We’ve done some forensics, and need your ideas on what we’ve discovered,” explains Araci.

“Do you mind if I explore?” asks Farj. Lupe gives him control of and he  rushes to examine the circuit board. “I don’t suppose you have the actual parts?”

“No, but we have something we think is related.” Araci opens the first box, displaying the electronics from Dakota’s desk. “Dakota was working on this, but we’re not sure what it is. We’re hoping you have some insight.”

Farj picks up the box and adjusts his visor, peering at the parts with high magnification. After a minute, Farj turns to Nilsson and makes a brief comment.

“It’s obvious Dakota was attempting to violate our intellectual property and patents,” Farj says to Lupe and Araci. “Much of this is stock components. We do it differently, but the logic is likely the same.”

Araci redirects the conversation. “Let’s look at this other box.”

Araci hands it to Farj; it contains what is left of the meal boxes. “These aren’t available on the market. I’m guessing it’s something you are working on and somehow Dakota got a sample.”

Nilsson seemed puzzled, but Farj is alarmed. He leans in and examines pieces of the exploded meal parts, taking pictures of each. Putting down the box, he adjusts his visor for several minutes. 

Farj sits back. “I’ll explain later,” he tells Nilsson. Nilsson rubs his head and objects, but Farj cuts him off.

“I really can’t talk about this,” Farj tells Araci. 

“Is it something you built? Did Dakota build it?” Araci tries to get an answer from Farj.

“No. I can’t discuss this without a lawyer present.” Farj abruptly stands and motions for Nilsson to do the same. “We need to catch the loop home.”

Araci knows there are plenty of hyperloops back to San Francisco. Farj is making an excuse to leave. Something about the meal has him on edge. They barely have time to end the meeting before Farj and Nilsson are out the door and gone.

“What was that?” asks Lupe.

“A tell,” replies Araci. “A clue. Maybe Abundancy has some ideas. And I have a hunch...”

Araci opens a call on his visor and shares it with Lupe. The same gray puppet appears.

“Um…Dakota Williams, search warrant, audit, non-profit,” says Araci. If he’s lucky, the AI will respond to those keywords. The puppet pauses, then twitches under human control.

“Detective Belo, what is it now?” The puppet performs an adequate simulation of annoyance.

“We have a question about a meal kit, as well as electronics Dakota put in the oven.”

“I - Abundancy - wouldn’t know anything about that,” says the puppet.

“I’d also like to speak with Robin Lopez,” says Araci. “I believe that would be you.”

The puppet freezes. “I don’t ... Robin isn’t ...,”

“I can get a privacy exemption if necessary,” says Araci. “So, Robin, shall we be real?”

The puppet looks away, then reshapes its features. Araci recognizes this new face as Robin from Dakota’s videos.

“We wondered where you were,” says Araci. “Hiding after someone dies is suspicious - wouldn’t you agree?”

“I’m trying to stay alive,” says Robin. “The explosion was not an accident. I stepped out to get us something to eat and when I returned, there were alarms and smoke. Dakota was dead and whoever caused the explosion might have still been around. I took a quick look, then ran.”

“Okay. You got scared and ran. Let’s accept that for now. But Dakota had installed a custom circuit board in the oven. Maybe an accident but suppose you two brought this on yourselves.”

“NO. We did not.” Robin chokes up. “Dakota was smart. And careful.”

“What was Dakota trying to do with this circuit?” Araci asks.

“It’s not that remarkable - her modification intercepts and logs commands from the meal. We were recording the cook process. With enough information we could build open source meals. Hestia is tricky about how they make the system work - we were going to free that up to the world. That’s why they killed Dakota.”

“That seems extreme,” starts Araci. “But where did that meal come from? Would I be able to purchase that from a grocery vendor?”

Robin hesitates. “Not yet.” He looks away for a minute, sighs, and looks back. “They aren’t commercially available. Friends of ours *found it* on a shipping dock.”

“So you stole an experimental meal, then stuffed it in a modified oven,” says Araci “This wasn’t a smart thing to do.”

“Hestia already tested - they were ready to release it. They somehow interfered with our experiment and set off a bomb. Dakota and I didn’t know that was possible or we wouldn’t have been doing that.”

“So you want me to believe Hestia reached out from the void and triggered an explosion?”

“Is that so hard to accept? They have access to everything. They can upgrade the oven software. They can shut it off. Why wouldn’t they aggressively defend their competitive advantage?”

“You said you were getting something to eat. But Dakota was cooking a meal.”

“Dakota was testing to see how the meal worked, not to eat it. Most of the time, the cooking process didn’t work, and the food was inedible. With earlier tests we could see the meal communicate with the oven, but Dakota’s circuit just logged the request. The meal assumed everything was fine. Most of it came out like old soybeans and congealed fat. Nasty stuff.”

// ---

At home, Araci is moving chairs for the robot vacuum when his visor announces a call. It’s someone using a privacy puppet.

“Hello Robin,” answers Araci. “Is there something new you’d like to discuss?”

“This isn’t Robin,” says the puppet. “I want to help you review your assumptions about Dakota Williams and Robin Lopez.”

Whoever is driving this animation has access to luxurious bandwidth. Robin’s puppet had been featureless. In comparison, this is a middle-age woman with astonishing detail in her face. Her hair is layered in an intricate simulation of a bob cut. Puppets are sometimes only rendered from the waist up; this is a full-body complete with sensible shoes.

“Well, I’ve got a lot of important things to do today.” Araci considers the vacuum cleaner. “But I’m always interested in a mystery. Please continue.”

“You need to consider the meal Dakota was playing with,” she says. “Unfortunately, there isn’t enough of it left for you to examine. If you don’t already know, you can’t buy them. Yet. Dakota’s accident only added a round of testing. It will not make a difference; They’re dangerous.” 

She continues, “They are difficult to understand. You would have to hire some high-powered electrical engineers and some equally high-powered food engineers, then do months of research to figure out what’s unusual about it.”

Araci sends the robot off to the other room. “You’re making a lot of claims and you tell me I don’t have the wattage to check your conclusions. I’ll state the obvious; why should I trust you?”

“Because I work for Hestia,” says the woman. She rubs her head in an un-feminine way, scrambling her neat hair style. “These new meals are going to get us in trouble, but I’m unable to convince anyone we should stop the project. Your investigation will make an impression.”

The woman produces a meal box from... somewhere. It is virtual sleight-of-hand, if such a thing could exist. “I’ve sent you one of these. When you get it, you’ll be able to prove what I’m about to show you.” It doubles in size, then changes to a cutaway view showing a starburst pattern of food cavities, channels, pumps, valves, and electronics. A chip throbs with a blue outline.

“This chip, the one outlined in blue, is a new concept for meals. It’s full-blown artificial intelligence. It doesn’t make the meal sing or dance. It just solves problems - like any other AI. But it does two special things: first, it confirms the food preparation process is going according to plan. If not, it adjusts the recipe to recover. Second, it sends that learning to our server.”

Araci sits down. The woman puppet takes a step closer and also sits, a chair materializing under her. A perfectly smooth animation; Araci forgot he was talking to thin air. 

“I assume all Hestia meals communicate with network,” says Araci.

“True. But we only collect what’s legal. Privacy laws restrict what can be recorded. This new meal dodges that restriction. It doesn’t record the actions from the user; it records the actions of the AI. The AI responds to the oven and the user. See the difference?”

“That’s a slim distinction. Something a judge would be interested in discussing.”

“Try Congress and legislation,” she says. “This is a game changer and not just for food.”

“Sounds like a job for a lobbyist. But back to what matters; I’m interested in what - or who - blew up Dakota.”

The puppet puts the meal back wherever it had appeared from. “It’s the AI. We can’t test it because we don’t have Dakota’s circuit and the telemetry from the meal is confused. We’re certain the AI tried to control things. The oven didn’t respond predictably, so the AI improvised. Somehow the AI decided it needed to open the gas valve. But the valve was already open. Dakota’s circuit gave the AI inaccurate information.”

“The meal allowed the tank to discharge the entire volume of gas. But the AI made a mistake and it sparked an igniter. If we release these meals without understanding the risks, consumers won’t trust Hestia or any of their products, let alone the ovens.”

“Maybe Dakota wasn’t wrong,” says Araci. “She may have been doing something unexpected, but that’s the nature of people. If your product doesn’t like that, maybe you ought to check your design?”

“You and I agree on that,” she says.

// ---

“*irasshaimase!*”

Lupe and Araci enter the restaurant and video screens scattered around the bar show a cartoon sushi chef cheerfully welcoming them for dinner. They sit at an open table. Four segments of a donut-shaped platform in the center of their table drop out of sight, one at a time, then rise up bearing drinks or food. 

Araci retrieves a beer, Lupe an old-fashioned; The empty squares drop, then return with a bowl of peanuts and a salad. A robotic chef at the side of the room whirs, mixing drinks and chopping food. It’s programmed to present Araci and Lupe with the most profitable menu.

“So. Whodunit?” asks Araci. “Robin thinks it was the friendly folks at Hestia. My mystery caller from Hestia thinks Dakota precipitated a fatal accident.”

Lupe squeezes the orange in her drink, bites off the fruit, then drops the peel in the garbage hole in the middle of the table. A slight vacuum pulls it away. “What if Robin did it? He was suspiciously absent.”

“He might have had the opportunity, but why? Dakota and Robin were on the same team, both for Abundancy and in a relationship.”

“I’ll agree. But I think nothing Dakota did was enough to light things up. Seems like her circuit was fail-safe. If something didn’t seem right, her circuit would just log the request.”

Araci picks up the peanuts, then moves to put them back down. Too late; they are charged to his tab, and the platform drops away, reappearing with a crudité platter. He surrenders and shells a peanut. “That leaves us with Hestia; or an unfortunate accident. But I’m not convinced Farj is a killer.”

“Maybe you need to focus on Robin.” Lupe shows an affectionate smile. “Or maybe you should have another beer and tell me more about your interesting past life.”

// ---

The meal box was waiting at Araci’s mail drop when he got home. Wrapped as a consumer package and with no return address, Araci has a justifiable concern as he brings it inside. Will Hestia make this explode as well?

When he awakes the next morning, the box is sitting exactly where he placed it. There is no evidence it has moved around during the night, or that it has released gas into the apartment. He needs to get this thing out of his life. 

Araci calls Abundancy; Robin answers immediately. 

“I’m going to need some help testing some crazy theories,” says Araci. “You’ve got the knowledge to understand the internals of this problem and you might be interested in the corporate side.”

Robin - who no longer uses a puppet - checks something off-screen. “I have access to a Hestia oven and a copy of the board Dakota was playing with. Is that the sort of setup you’re looking for?”

“Close enough,” replies Araci. “Let’s meet. I’ll bring a meal.”

// ---

Araci summons a public car and directs it to the location Robin mentioned; an artist’s building, four floors of small studios all wrapped up in one big fire hazard. He knocked on the door of room 327 and meets Robin face-to-face for the first time.

“I brought dinner,” says Araci. He holds out the meal sent by his anonymous lady friend.

“How convenient,” replies Robin. “I’ve got an oven.”

Robin ushers Araci into an open room with no windows. Steel columns brace the walls in a minimally legal attempt to be earthquake proof. A workbench stretches across one wall, covered with electronic test gear. In the center is an oven with wire - actual wires - running from the oven to the diagnostic machines. 

“I’m going to assume this is all legal and code-compliant,” says Araci. “At least, I won’t ask, so please don’t tell.”

Robin looks at him but reveals nothing. He powers up the oven and displays on the workbench. They reflected frantic communication coming from the oven. But Araci can not decipher what it means. 

“What are we testing?” asks Robin.

“One of my new friends called,” says Araci. “They said the meal has an AI chip that didn’t enjoy talking to Dakota’s custom board. They consider the explosion was a miscommunication.”

“We didn’t even think there might be AI in the meal. That’s serious engineering; way more than we gave Hestia credit for. Let’s look.”

“Whoa - before you connect this up, are we going to die in an unplanned fire?” Araci holds back. “I’d like to avoid that.”

Robin points at a display on the bench. “I’ve simulated the gas tank. The meal should be happier about the oven response.” 

Araci surrenders the meal to Robin and takes a precautionary step backward from the project. Robin places the meal inside the oven.

The previously frantic displays became a blur. Robin goes to the workbench, taps a control once, then twice. The display converts to a summary and shows an overview of the oven’s activities.

“Oh - look at that!” Robin watches a an exhibit of flashing boxes and lines. He looks at Araci, realizing a better explanation was necessary. “It’s the meal talking to the oven. There’s so much more than Dakota expected. The AI explains a lot when you recognize it.”

Araci can only guess at the story Robin is watching. Three displays jittered with confusing diagnostics; Robin bounces from one station on the workbench to another.

With all the activity, it’s misleading to think of something suddenly changing - but it does. One screen freezes. Another changes its layout. The third continues, but at one-half the speed. Robin looks at the oven. “What are you doing?” he asks. Not to Araci - to the oven.

Robin slaps a large red button straight out of a comic book. The workbench and oven abruptly shut down. He turns to face Araci.

“This was not an accident,” says Robin. He hesitates, then paces, checking inactive displays and tracing wires. “The meal just tried to start a fire. Not just turn on the oven - it tried to blow the entire room to pieces. It told the oven to release a huge volume of gas then to ignite. It was deliberate.”

Robin resets the “big red button” then waves up some log files, sharing them with Araci. 

“Here. Right here,” Robin points at a paragraph in the narrative log. “The AI decides it’s being reverse-engineered. It knows what’s going on - someone programmed it to watch for this. It’s trying to self-destruct, just like a piece of military hardware might do when it winds up in enemy hands. That’s a hell of a way to protect intellectual property.”

“Hestia did this?” asks Araci.

“This is a Hestia meal, so yes. If Hestia gets away with it, then it becomes an industry standard. After that, AI defense of intellectual property will be pervasive.”

“Isn’t this all extreme?” asks Araci. “Exploding ovens are going to attract attention. That would be a publicity nightmare. Not to mention liability.”

“You’d think so,” says Robin. “But we’re talking about AI. Not linear algorithms. You never know what the AI layers and nodes are doing. It might act when it decides it’s being reverse-engineered. It’s just as possible the AI could decide to terminate because a location doesn’t have solid IP laws. Or who knows? AIs make conclusions without human guidance. But they don’t have a value for self-worth, so they can choose self-immolation as the low-cost option to protect the code.”

Robin continues. “I’m speculating, but if Hestia decides it’s ok for a meal to self-destruct, they might also decide it’s ok for an oven to self-destruct. This oven already has simple AI for trouble-shooting and self-maintenance. It wouldn’t be difficult to put in a higher-level AI to detect a non-approved meal kit. You could even have two AIs - one in a rogue meal and one in the oven - and they’d be kick-boxing with each other. God help the poor schmuck standing nearby.”

Araci understood. This wasn’t just about Dakota anymore.

Araci meets the three Hestia representatives at a police target range outside of Portland. Trees surround the field - typical for Oregon. Earth berms circle the center of the field. In front of the targets is a shed with a large open door. At the shooting platform three chairs face a table with a drape covering a cubical object.

“Thanks for joining me again,” Araci begins. “Please take a seat and I’ll show you a brief demonstration that might explain some of my confusion.”

The chairs are rough, but someone had the courtesy to put a water bottle on each. Lupe and another officer stand off to the side, dressed in protective gear. Araci stands in front of the chairs with his back to the table.

“Lupe and I got here a bit before you to set this up.” Araci removes the drape to reveal a Hestia oven and a meal box. “I’m going to ask our officers to run this table downrange, place it in the shed, and connect power to this oven.”

“We know how Hestia ovens work,” asserts Broin. “Couldn’t we have just sent you a promotional video?”

“This meal behaves a bit differently,” replies Araci. Downrange, Lupe connects power to the oven and pushes in the meal, then both officers hustle back to the chairs.

“Let’s give this a minute,” says Araci. He turns to watch the table. Farj objects - but is interrupted by an explosion. The table, oven, and meal disappear in a cloud of smoke billowing out of the shed. When the air clears, only the table remains.

“The last time we met, I knew little about what Dakota was doing. I didn’t realize she had an experimental Hestia meal box. But I suspect you realized that when you saw the serial number and made your abrupt exit.”

Farj looks at Nilsson and Broin; Broin stares, Nilsson nervously rubs his head. They obviously discussed this between themselves already.

“This meal,” Araci gestures downrange, “is like the one Dakota placed in her modified Hestia oven. We’ve learned it contains artificial intelligence. The explosion is what happens when one of these unknown meals talks with a Hestia Oven in a diagnostic mode. The meal instructs the oven to stop attempts at reverse-engineering. If the oven doesn’t stop, the meal fights back. We believe this happened to Dakota Williams.”

“Hestia would never instruct an AI to react like this,” interjects Ms. Broin. “It’s bad corporate relations and speaking for the Hestia legal department, it’s not something we would advise.”

“See, that’s the thing,” replies Araci. “You don’t tell an AI how to behave. AI chooses from options. You just provide desired endpoints. Here, a *manufacturer* - and by manufacturer, I mean *you* - only needs to instruct the AI of the problem, then sit back and let it sort out the best resolution. If you don’t restrict it from a specific method, it remains a viable choice. More directly, if you don’t tell it explosions are *not* an acceptable solution, then explosions remain an acceptable solution.”

Farj is tapping his foot. 

“Defensive AI in a meal is one thing,” Araci says. “Now let’s talk about defensive AI in an oven.” Araci addressed his statements directly to Farj. “If an oven were equipped with AI that obstructed competitive meals, and that oven was involved in suspicious events, well, that would be *problematic*. Do you see what I’m saying?”

Farj looks at Broin, who shakes her head *No!* The unspoken communication is clear; Hestia has already been engaged in exactly this type of project. Nilsson rubs his head with vigor; Araci could only imagine he was planning how to address this at a shareholder meeting.

“I think we understand your point,” says Farj. “We are limited in our ability to discuss this at length. I assume we’ll be in touch if you have other concerns.”

“Actually, we will have plenty of time. I’ve brought along a warrant for your arrest. Something about conspiracy to defraud, but I’m sure Ms. Broin will be interested in details. Ms. Broin, I’m glad you’re here, Mr. Capcin will appreciate your assistance.”

Lupe escorts Farj to a waiting police vehicle, followed by Broin. Nilsson does not move, but stares downrange.

“I appreciate what you’ve done to make this possible,” says Araci. “I hope I’ve lived up to your expectations. And I share your desire for Hestia to do the right thing.”

“It’s a costly lesson,” replies Nilsson. “And I’m struggling with Dakota’s death. Maybe Abundancy needs help. If I can prevent Hestia from doing this, I can block other companies from following suite.”

“I don’t know,” responds Araci. “We humans are always looking for novel ways to kill ourselves.” He stands. “I’m hungry, let’s get lunch. I’ve heard of a new Iraqi restaurant.”
