# summary

A patient with increasing dementia is fitted for a neuroprothesis for bladder control. This version is upgradeable, and over time, enhancements are made to control alzheimers.

This patient becomes more dependent on the prothesis. Eventually the patient disappears and only the prothesis remains. The patient is a meat puppet, kept alive and ambulatory by the prothesis. But the prothesis lacks motivation, imagination. Both are trapped in a symbiotic relationship until one or the other dies.
