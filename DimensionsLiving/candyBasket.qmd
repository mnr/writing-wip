## Six Hallways

There are six residence hallways where I live; three in assisted living and three in the independent wing. Each hallway services six or more rooms. Each room has a small cubby to the left of the door. Each cubby has a personality reflective of the resident of the room. Ours hosts a Buddha.

Most cubbies have pictures of Jesus or Mary. Many have ceramic dogs or cats (usually not both). There are plants and flags and war memorabilia and drawings by grandchildren. A few have artwork created by the occupant; Jan makes mandala patterns on rocks. Dave used to post his abstract sketches.

I have not seen any flamingos, goldfish, hamsters, neon beer signs, dancing hula girls, gumball machines, coin-operated video games, occupant photos, and historical plaques.

A few doors host bird houses. Unlike the Fleet Farm across the street, there are no birds flying loose in our building and I haven't seen any avian activity. Given the chance, I believe my fellow residents would do whatever is necessary to supply nesting materials. I also believe health codes would discourage live flying animals. If these two forces were to come in conflict, my fellow residents (comrades?) and I would rise up for animal rights.

## The Candy Basket

I live at the far end of the second floor of the independent wing. My mother-in-law lives on the first floor of the assisted wing. Because of this, I regularly travel the length of the building, passing over or through the dining hall depending on which staircase I choose.
