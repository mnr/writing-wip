There are six residence hallways where I live; three in assisted living and three in the independent wing. Each hallway services six or more rooms. Each room has a small cubby to the left of the door. Each cubby has a personality reflective of the resident of the room. Ours hosts a Buddha.

Most cubbies have pictures of Jesus or Mary. Many have ceramic dogs or cats (usually not both). There are plants and flags and war memorabilia and drawings by grandchildren. A few have artwork created by the occupant; Jan makes mandala patterns on rocks. Dave used to post his abstract sketches.

I have not seen any flamingos, goldfish, hamsters, neon beer signs, dancing hula girls, gumball machines, coin-operated video games, occupant photos, historical plaques,
