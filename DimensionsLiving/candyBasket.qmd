## Six Hallways

There are seven hallways in the residence where I live; three are in the assisted living wing, three are in the independent wing, and one is in the memory wing. Each hallway services six or more rooms. Each room has a door with a small cubby to the side. It's a blank space that invites personal expression by the occupant of the room. Most cubbies have pictures of Jesus or Mary. Many have ceramic dogs or cats (but not both). There are plants and flags and war memorabilia and ceramic figures and wind chimes and drawings by grandchildren.

A few have artwork created by the occupant; our neighbor Jan paints mandala patterns on rocks. I have not seen any lawn flamingos, neon beer signs, dancing hula girls, gum ball machines, coin-operated video games, or historical plaques.

A few host bird houses. There are no birds flying loose in our building and I haven't seen any avian activity in the small houses. Given the chance, I believe the residents would encourage their presence and supply nesting materials. I also believe health codes discourage live flying animals. If these two forces were to come in conflict, my fellow residents (comrades?) and I would rise up for animal rights.

For our cubby, I considered an inflatable flappy-arm guy like you see at tire and furniture stores. At 20 feet tall, this would be crowded by the eight-foot ceiling, plus the one-horsepower fan might generate more noise than my neighbors are comfortable with. Maybe I'll consider a target-practice deer with replaceable core. Until I act otherwise, ours hosts a Buddha.

My father experienced difficulties navigating the halls of his residence. Honestly, so did I. There were three possible routes to the dining room, each with additional hallways leading to other wings of the building. There were no street names or hallway signs. Every route was the same color. There were no maps on the walls. He realized one route to the dining room was marked by a large mirror at the far end. He arrived at dinner by walking towards himself.

Roads in older European cities reflect the random walk of a horse cart avoiding rocks, trees, and fences. Streets are named, but rarely labeled. If labeled, they have two (or more) names. You *will* be lost on the first trip from hotel to restaurant. Your only hope is to look for landmarks. In Venice, my hotel was three doors down from the purple umbrella. In Cortona, I go to the main plaza, turn right at the church steps and go up the steepest road that does not pass the gellato store. In Japan, I kept the drying persimmons to the right, turned towards the cash machine, then opening the door marked with the AC/DC sticker.

In my residence here in Stevens Point, Wisconsin, I walk towards the elevator, turn right, and look for the candy basket.

## The Candy Basket

I live at the far end of the second floor of the independent wing. My mother-in-law lives on the first floor of the assisted wing. Because of this, I regularly travel the length of the building, passing over or through the dining hall, depending on which staircase I choose. If I choose to traverse on the second floor, I pass apartment 207.

The resident of 207 hosts a candy basket in their cubby. The basket is white with a woven handle and some pastel accents. A young child could carry it with ease and when I search the internet, I find it listed as a wedding flower girl basket, priced at about ten dollars. At the Goodwill thrift store I've seen entire aisles filled with these baskets, each reasonably priced at two dollars. If you shop Goodwill on half-price days and apply your senior citizen discount, you might obtain one for fifty-cents.

I have never seen the basket of room 207 empty of candy. Before I became involved, the basket exclusively contained small candy bars. The size of the basket restricts the size of the candy. There isn't room for full size chocolate bars. Instead, expect to find bite-sized treats. Think *halloween trick-or-treat.* If you need a serious chocolate fix, Fleet Farm is right across the street. There's a gourmet chocolate shop downtown. Plan ahead.

I wish I had recorded weekly observations on the type and quantity of the contents. It would have made a lovely graph, showing candy consumption over time. Before you fault me for not being a fastidious data scientist, consider the optics of digging through the basket once a day and writing notes on a clipboard. In good conscious I would wear rubber gloves, which would be all the more disconcerting to a third-party observer. *Don't worry. I'm honestly not mixing mind-control drugs in with the snickers bars.* I might as well wear a white lab coat and eye protection and sneak around after 6:00 p.m. This would surely alarm my fellow residents and possibly start conspiracy theories.

Instead, I performed a rather unstructured experiment. I purchased peanut butter cups (a personal favorite) and stealithly contributed to the basket. Discovering their absence the next day was every bit as exciting as finding Santa had consumed the cookies and milk we had provided the previous night. Without counting (again--creepy behavior) I observed my contribution was more popular than other brands. Huzzah!

But bags of individually wrapped *fun size* chocolates cost about four dollars and last about two days. This rate of consumption would quickly exceed my research grant, so I looked for alternatives. I found two options: "Dum dums," which are small suckers, cost about half that much. Tootsie Roll Midgees provide an overwhelming piece per dollar value. I purchased a bag of each and seeded the basket.

My experimentation revealed a truth; nobody in my community likes dum dums or tootsie rolls. They are just obstructional flotsam my friends dig through in their search for chocolate. If you have squirrels digging in your garden, you're familiar with the holes and mounds they make. This is the same phenomena I've seen in this candy basket. Holes and mounds. Chocolate bars are picked out; the dum dums and tootsie rolls remain behind.

This may be related to the dental health of my elder friends; tootsie rolls can be problematic with loose fillings or uncertain dental implants. I don't have a workable hypothesis to explain the dearth of dum dum consumption, but it may be related to Kojack's trademark tough-guy sucker-sucking style. If you're going to wander the halls with a sucker sticking out of your mouth, you need to do it with a bit of attitude. Haven't seen it yet, but it wouldn't surprise me.

I thought of including healthier snacks; bags of nuts, dried fruit, veggie chips. These are on the low end of piece per dollar but I suspect they won't be much more popular than tootsie rolls. And I may be missing the point. The candy basket belongs to the resident of room 207. They aren't running a hotel mini-bar. They are sharing their hope for a brighter world where we offer small gifts to the people around us. Maybe I shouldn't tamper with the universe.

## Hallway Artwork

Some doors feature artwork. I will forever regret not introducing myself to Dave Smith, an art professor and member of my community. He dabbled in an abstract type of art he described as *Scarabocchio* - Italian for *scribble*. His door was a wild display of politics, opinions, and his multi-colored artwork. His door screamed I AM ECCENTRIC, I AM PROUD OF IT, IT IS WHO I AM. When you are in Stevens Point, Wisconsin, you can visit his museum.

Unfortunately, his artwork never made it any further than the museum and his door. Instead, the halls of my residence are decorated with bland hotel artwork. These prints are designed to be less interesting the longer you look at them. They are chosen so the colors of the art match the paint of the hallway, rather than wall colors which accentuate the art. The corporate Optics and Design department strives for a calming theme that won't disrupt anyone's delicate sensibilities. 

This pisses me off. Who the hell made the decision I need to be calmed? Some corporate focus group concluded if residents are presented with visually challenging artwork we will require weeks of therapy. Worse, our children and heirs will initiate lawsuits to collect for mental anguish. 

Corporate design teams forget I live with college professors. Poets. Musicians. Librarians. World War II veterans who RAN into combat with a single-shot carbine and a green cotton shirt. I live with men and women who scraped a living out of a potato field but now miss their farm. How dare you mount a piece of art intended to calm. me. down. WTF?

I have discovered the current art is mounted with adhesive tape - not screws. With one quick yank, I can replace "Pheasant on the Prairie" with "The Persistence of Memory." I can dismount the western landscape and replace it with John Berkey's "Feather Ship." I can replace "Sunset over the desert" with "The Sly Shy Spotted Sagacious Snipper Snapper." I can slip down the deserted halls and sow discontent and rebellion.

I think Dave Smith would approve.
