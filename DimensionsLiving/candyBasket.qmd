## Six Hallways

There are six residence hallways where I live; three in the assisted living wing and three in the independent wing. Each hallway services six or more rooms. Each room has a small cubby to the left of the door. Each cubby has a personality reflective of the resident of the room. Ours hosts a Buddha.

Most cubbies have pictures of Jesus or Mary. Many have ceramic dogs or cats (usually not both). There are plants and flags and war memorabilia and ceramic figures and wind chimes and drawings by grandchildren. A few have artwork created by the occupant; Jan makes mandala patterns on rocks. Dave used to post abstract sketches.

I have not seen any flamingos, goldfish, hamsters, neon beer signs, dancing hula girls, gum ball machines, coin-operated video games, occupant photos, and historical plaques.

A few host bird houses. Unlike the Fleet Farm big box store across the street, there are no birds flying loose in our building and I haven't seen any avian activity in the small houses. Given the chance, I believe my fellow residents would do whatever is necessary to supply nesting materials. I also believe health codes would discourage live flying animals. If these two forces were to come in conflict, my fellow residents (comrades?) and I would rise up for animal rights.

## The Candy Basket

I live at the far end of the second floor of the independent wing. My mother-in-law lives on the first floor of the assisted wing. Because of this, I regularly travel the length of the building, passing over or through the dining hall, depending on which staircase I choose. If I choose to traverse on the second floor, I pass apartment 207.

The resident of 207 hosts a candy basket. It is white, with a woven handle. A young child could carry it with ease, and when I search the internet, I find it listed as a wedding flower girl basket, priced at about ten dollars. At the Goodwill thrift store I've seen entire rows of these, reasonably priced at two dollars. If you shop Goodwill on half-price days and apply your senior citizen discount, you might obtain one for fifty-cents.

I have never seen the basket empty of candy. I'm sorry to say I didn't record weekly observations on the type and quantity of the contents. That data would have made a lovely graph, showing population over time. Before you fault me for not being a good observer, consider the optics of digging through the basket once a day and recording my observations on a clipboard. In good conscious I would wear rubber gloves, which would be even a bit more disconcerting to a third-party observer. *Don't worry. I'm honestly not mixing mind-control drugs in with the snickers bars.* I might as well wear a white lab coat and eye protection and sneak around after 7:00 p.m. so I could alarm the residents and start conspiracy theories.   

The size of the basket restricts the size of the contents. There isn't room for full size chocolate bars. Instead, expect to find bite-sized treats. Think *halloween trick-or-treat.* Seriously, this isn't supposed to be a hotel mini-bar. It's a token of friendship, not an attempt to satisfy gluttonous desires. If you need a chocolate fix, Fleet Farm is right across the street. There's a gourmet chocolate shop downtown. Plan ahead. 

Peanut butter cups are my favorite, not so much anything with coconut. Anything with chocolate disappears in a day. I've done some experimentation with candy preferences. My first was small suckers, also known as "dum dums."
