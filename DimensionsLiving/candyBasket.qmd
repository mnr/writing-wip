## Six Hallways

There are six hallways in the residence where I live; three are in the assisted living wing and three are in the independent wing. Each hallway services six or more rooms. Each room has a small cubby to the left of the door. It's a blank space that invites personal expression by the occupant of the room. Most cubbies have pictures of Jesus or Mary. Many have ceramic dogs or cats (but not both). There are plants and flags and war memorabilia and ceramic figures and wind chimes and drawings by grandchildren.

A few have artwork created by the occupant; our neighbor Jan paints mandala patterns on rocks. Dave Smith posted abstract sketches. He called them Scarabocchio and there is a museum in Stevens Point, Wisconsin dedicated to his art. I have not seen any flamingos, goldfish, hamsters, neon beer signs, dancing hula girls, gum ball machines, coin-operated video games, or historical plaques.

A few host bird houses. Unlike the Fleet Farm big box store across the street, there are no birds flying loose in our building and I haven't seen any avian activity in the small houses. Given the chance, I believe my fellow residents would encourage their presence and supply nesting materials. I also believe health codes discourage live flying animals. If these two forces were to come in conflict, my fellow residents (comrades?) and I would rise up for animal rights.

For our cubby, I thought it would be amusing to place an inflatable flappy-arm guy, but at 20 feet tall, this would be crowded by the eight-foot ceiling. Plus the one-horsepower fan might generate more noise than my neighbors are comfortable with. Maybe I'll consider a target-practice deer with replaceable core. Until I act, ours hosts a Buddha. 

## The Candy Basket

I live at the far end of the second floor of the independent wing. My mother-in-law lives on the first floor of the assisted wing. Because of this, I regularly travel the length of the building, passing over or through the dining hall, depending on which staircase I choose. If I choose to traverse on the second floor, I pass apartment 207.

The resident of 207 hosts a candy basket in their cubby. The basket is white with a woven handle and some pastel accents. A young child could carry it with ease and when I search the internet, I find it listed as a wedding flower girl basket, priced at about ten dollars. At the Goodwill thrift store I've seen entire rows of these, each reasonably priced at two dollars. If you shop Goodwill on half-price days and apply your senior citizen discount, you might obtain one for fifty-cents.

I have never seen this basket empty of candy. I wish I had thought to record weekly observations on the type and quantity of the contents. It would have made a lovely graph, showing candy consumption over time. Before you fault me for not being a good data scientist, consider the optics of digging through the basket once a day and recording my observations on a clipboard. In good conscious I would wear rubber gloves, which would be even more disconcerting to a third-party observer. *Don't worry. I'm honestly not mixing mind-control drugs in with the snickers bars.* I might as well wear a white lab coat and eye protection and sneak around after 7:00 p.m. This would surely alarm my fellow residents and start conspiracy theories.   

The basket usually contains small candy bars, although I have broken this trend. The size of the basket restricts the size of the contents. There isn't room for full size chocolate bars. Instead, expect to find bite-sized treats. Think *halloween trick-or-treat.* If you need a serious chocolate fix, Fleet Farm is right across the street. There's a gourmet chocolate shop downtown. Plan ahead.

Peanut butter cups are my favorite, not so much anything with coconut. My fellow residents prefer chocolate, which I know for a fact because I have done some experimentation. I decided early that I would be a contributor to this candy basket. It's another way I add to my community. But bags of individually wrapped *fun size* chocolates cost about four dollars and last about two days. Over time, that gets to be an expensive hobby. So I looked for alternatives. "Dum dums," which are small suckers, cost about half that much. Tootsie Roll Midgees provide an overwhelming piece per dollar value.

My experimentation quick revealed a truth; nobody in my community likes Dum dums or tootsie rolls. They are just useless filler my friends dig through in their search for chocolate. If you have squirrels digging in your garden, you're familiar with the holes and mounds they make. This is the same phenomena I've seen in this candy basket. Holes and mounds. Chocolate bars are quickly picked out; the Dum dums and tootsie rolls remain behind.

This may be related to the dental health of my elder friends; tootsie rolls can be problematic with loose fillings or uncertain dental implants. I'm not sure about Dum dums but it may be related to Kojack's trademark tough-guy sucker-sucking style. If you're going to wander the halls with a sucker sticking out of your mouth, you need to carry it with a bit of attitude. I haven't seen it yet, but it's not beyond what I might expect.

I thought of including healthier snacks; bags of nuts, dried fruit, veggie chips. These are on the low end of piece per dollar and I suspect they won't be much more popular than tootsie rolls. And I may be missing the point. The candy basket belongs to the resident of room 207. They aren't running a hotel mini-bar. They are sharing their hope for a brighter world where we offer small gifts to the people around us. It's not that hard.

## Hallway Artwork

Some doors feature artwork. I will forever regret not introducing myself to Dave Smith, an art professor and member of my community. He dabbled in an abstract type of art he described as *Scarabocchio* - Italian for *scribble*. His door was a wild display of politics, opinions, and his multi-colored artwork. His door screamed I AM ECCENTRIC, I AM PROUD OF IT, IT IS WHO I AM. I am sorry I didn't attend his funeral; I would have stolen some of his ideas for my own.

Unfortunately, his artwork never made it any further than the museum and his door. In polite circles, the artwork hanging in the halls of my residence is *bland.* These paintings are designed to be less interesting the longer you look at them. They are chosen so the colors match the paint, rather than paint accentuating the artwork. Whichever corporate department is in charge of Optics and Design strives for a calming theme that won't disrupt anyone's delicate sensibilities. 

This pisses me off. Who the hell made the decision I need to be calmed? Someone has the idea if I am presented with visually challenging artwork I will melt into an emotional puddle and require weeks of therapy. Perhaps if  artwork is stimulating it will cause a lawsuit? 

I live with college professors. Poets. Musicians. Librarians. World War II veterans who RAN into combat with a single-shot carbine and a green cotton shirt. I live with women who watched their men drop into a grave, then went on living without their companion. I live with men who scraped a living out of the ground and yet still miss their farm. How dare you mount a piece of art intended to calm. me. down. WTF?

I haven't replaced hallway art (yet), but I do know the current art is mounted with adhesive tape - not screws. With one quick yank, I can replace "Pheasant on the Prairie" with "The Persistence of Memory." I can dismount the western landscape and replace it with John Berkey's "Feather Ship." I could replace "Sunset over the desert" with "The Sly Shy Spotted Sagacious Snipper Snapper." But I need to be careful. Once a single piece of art is changed, it's likely there will be more. I think Dave Smith would approve.
