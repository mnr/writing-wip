## Appendix
Here is R code to build a Bingo card...

```{r}
gimmeFive <- function(range) {
  as.character(sample(x = range, size = 5))
}

BingoMatrix <- matrix(data = c(gimmeFive(1:15),
                               gimmeFive(16:30),
                               gimmeFive(31:45),
                               gimmeFive(46:60),
                               gimmeFive(61:75)),
                      nrow = 5)

colnames(BingoMatrix) <- c("B","I","N","G","O")

BingoMatrix[3,3] <- "Free"

BingoMatrix
