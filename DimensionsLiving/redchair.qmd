## Flotsom

American ghosts are vengeful, horrifying entities. 

Unless you are christian, in which case they are holy. 

Personally, I think we leave echoes of our lives and we call them ghosts for lack of a more sophisticated word. Some of these echoes are formal and intentional:  tombstones, memorials, buildings, libraries, or Facebook accounts. Some are transitory and mysterious: a sense of being watched, sounds in the house, objects disappearing and reappearing, conversations in dreams. Some are simply the collective pressure of things we leave behind: clothing, fishing rods, photos, creamtion ashes, toothbrushes.

Along with our apartment, we were given a security cage for large or dirty items. It's located in the basement, next to a large collection of wheelchairs, walkers, assistive toilet devices, and easy lift recliners. I assume these were left behind by former residents. Former, as in *moved on*. I haven't dug for the history, but I suspect these are no longer of use to the previous owner or their children.

These items are in an unsightly pile in a dark and dusty part of the garage. There's not enough dramatic lighting, creepy features, or ominous soundtrack to warrant hauntings. Nobody comes down here except to drive their cars. The flotsom sits in an uninteresting pile of uninteresting equipment.

Except...the red chair.

## Theft of the red chair

Amidst the walkers and wheelchairs is a red, leather, La-Z-Boy recliner. It is in perfect condition, no rips or worn-through patches. This chair has a large wood lever on the right side to control the extension of the footrest. Lean back in the chair and it expands to your length. Move to sit upright or stand and it will fold out of the way. It is designed to make you comfortable; this is why it exists. It knows the how and why of existence without the benefit of microprocessor or bluetooth connection.

The only wear-and-tear is a discolored area where someone's head might have rested. The arms on the chair are slightly faded, evidence of the long-term presence of someone's arms. It's easy to see how it has cradled a sleeping senior, having fallen asleep to late night television. Both chair and owner rest peacefully until one morning the owner neglects to greet the morning. The apartment is cleaned, nobody wants the chair, and it is hauled to the basement. For the chair, this is the opposite of the balloon layer.

I'm told not everyone knows about the balloon layer. How sad. If you are a parent or grandparent or aunt or uncle, you will need to know this. Give a child a helium balloon. If you don't tie it to their wrist, they will accidentally release it. The expression on a child watching a balloon sail into the distance is photogenic, but distressing. Tears and wailing will ensue. 

This is your opportunity to inform your child about the balloon layer. All balloons aspire to join their fellow balloons in this glorious place, but they are held captive in the mortal layer until a child releases them. How grateful the balloon is and how happy this child might be, knowing they have dispensed charity to a simple balloon. It's a nice story, but if the child is quick, they will realize this is an opportunity for a vast magnanomous guesture by purchasing ALL of the balloons and releasing them from their captivity. Or they may race about the playground, freeing balloons from the clutches of less-informed peers.

However, I'm discussing chairs.

I assume whatever echoes the owner of the chair has left behind finds us and whisper a sales pitch. It is the ghost's favorite chair and has a vested interest in ensuring its future well-being.  *It's mechanically perfect!* whispers the ghost. The chair behaves like any kennel dog, straightens it's shoulders and looks at us with a hopeful expression. *It's valued at $1,800 dollars retail.* The chair does its best to hide the dust on its arms and seat. *You need such a chair!*

My wife doesn't hesitate. "Get the dolly, we're taking this chair to our room."

## Not so fast
