## Flotsom

American ghosts are vengeful, horrifying entities. Unless you are christian, in which case they are holy. Personally, I think we leave echoes of our lives. Some of these are formal and intentional:  tombstones, memorials, buildings, libraries, or Facebook accounts. Some are transitory and mysterious: being watched, sounds in the house, objects disappearing and reappearing, conversations in dreams. Some are simply the collective pressure of things we leave behind: clothing, fishing rods, photos, creamtion ashes, toothbrushes.

Along with our apartment, we were given a security cage for large or dirty items. It's located in the basement, next to a large collection of wheelchairs, walkers, assistive toilet devices, and easy lift recliners. I assume these were left behind by former residents. Former, as in *moved on*. I haven't dug for answers, but I suspect these are no longer of use to the previous owner or their children.

These are in an unsightly pile in a dark and dusty part of the garage. There's not enough dramatic lighting and creepy features to warrant hauntings. Nobody comes down here except to drive off with their cars. The flotsom sits in an uninteresting pile of uninteresting devices.

Except...the red chair.

## Theft of the red chair

Amidst the walkers and wheelchairs was a red, leather, La-Z-Boy recliner. It is in perfect condition, no rips or worn-through patches. This chair has a large wood lever on the right side to control the extension of the footrest. Lean back in the chair and it expands to your length. Move to sit upright or stand and it will fold out of the way. It is designed to make you comfortable; this is why it exists. It knows this, without the benefit of microprocessor or bluetooth connection.

The only wear-and-tear is a discolored area where someone's head might have rested. It's easy to see how it has cradled a sleeping senior, having fallen asleep to late night television. Both chair and owner rest peacefully until one morning the owner neglects to greet the morning. The apartment is cleaned, nobody wants the chair, and it relocates to the basement. This is the opposite of the balloon layer.

I assume whatever echoes the owner has left behind have found us and whisper a sales pitch. *It's mechanically perfect!* whispers the ghost. The chair behaves like any kennel dog, straightens it's shoulders and looks at us with a hopeful expression. *It's valued at $1,800 dollars retail.* The chair does its best to hide the dust on it's arms and seat. *You need such a chair!*

My wife doesn't hesitate. "Get the dolly, we're taking this chair to our room."
