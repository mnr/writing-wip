## Flotsom

American ghosts are vengeful, horrifying entities. 

Unless you are christian, in which case they are holy. 

Personally, I think we leave echoes of our lives and we call them ghosts for lack of a more sophisticated word. Some of these echoes are formal and intentional:  tombstones, memorials, buildings, libraries, or Facebook accounts. Some are transitory and mysterious: a sense of being watched, sounds in the house, objects disappearing and reappearing, conversations in dreams. Some are simply the collective pressure of things we leave behind: clothing, fishing rods, photos, creamtion ashes, toothbrushes.

Along with our apartment, we were given a security cage for large or dirty items. It's located in the basement, next to a large collection of wheelchairs, walkers, assistive toilet devices, and easy lift recliners. I assume these were left behind by former residents. Former, as in *moved on*. I haven't dug for the history, but I suspect these are no longer of use to the previous owner or their children.

These items are in an unsightly pile in a dark and dusty part of the garage. There's not enough dramatic lighting, creepy features, or ominous soundtrack to warrant hauntings. Nobody comes down here except to drive their cars. The flotsom sits in an uninteresting pile of uninteresting equipment.

Except...the red chair.

## Theft of the red chair

Amidst the walkers and wheelchairs is a red, leather, La-Z-Boy recliner. It is in perfect condition, no rips or worn-through patches. This chair has a large wood lever on the right side to control the extension of the footrest. Lean back in the chair and it expands to your length. Move to sit upright or stand and it will fold out of the way. It is designed to make you comfortable; this is why it exists. It knows the how and why of existence without the benefit of microprocessor or bluetooth connection.

The only wear-and-tear is a discolored area where someone's head might have rested. The arms on the chair are slightly faded, evidence of the long-term presence of someone's arms. It's easy to see how it has cradled a sleeping senior, having fallen asleep to late night television. Both chair and owner rest peacefully until one morning the owner neglects to greet the morning. The apartment is cleaned, nobody wants the chair, and it is hauled to the basement. For the chair, this is the opposite of the balloon layer.

I'm told not everyone knows about the balloon layer. How sad. If you are a parent or grandparent or aunt or uncle, you will need to know this. Give a child a helium balloon. If you don't tie it to their wrist, they will accidentally release it. The expression on a child watching a balloon sail into the distance is photogenic, but distressing. Tears and wailing will ensue. 

This is your opportunity to inform your child about the balloon layer. All balloons aspire to join their fellow balloons in this glorious place, but they are held captive in the mortal layer until a child releases them. How grateful the balloon is and how happy this child might be, knowing they have dispensed charity to a simple balloon. It's a nice story, but if the child is quick, they will realize this is an opportunity for a vast magnanomous guesture by purchasing ALL of the balloons and releasing them from their captivity. Or they may race about the playground, freeing balloons from the clutches of less-informed peers.

However, I'm discussing chairs.

I assume whatever echoes the owner of the chair has left behind finds us and whisper a sales pitch. It is the ghost's favorite chair and has a vested interest in ensuring its future well-being.  *It's mechanically perfect!* whispers the ghost. The chair behaves like any kennel dog, straightens it's shoulders and looks at us with a hopeful expression. *It's valued at $1,800 dollars retail.* The chair does its best to hide the dust on its arms and seat. *You need such a chair!*

My wife doesn't hesitate. "Get the dolly, we're taking this chair to our room."

## Not so fast

Administration knows about this chair. It has a history and a death sentence. The ghost of its previous owner did not mention the bedbug infestation and pending one-way appointment with the dumpster.

If I was the ghost, I might be guilty of a similar omission. We learned this chair was one of a set, its partner had already made the one-way dumpster journey. Our ghost had seen the future and like Marley in *A Christmas Carol* was doing its best to prevent the repeat of that dismal fate. We unknowingly participated in the clandestine rescue of this chair and the relief of the ghost.

Housekeeping ratted us out. They saw the chair and reported its salvation to administration who sent their angels of destruction to warn us of our offenses. We must return the chair to suffer its undeserved fate. The certification of assisted living facilities does not allow bedbugs; this chair is suspect and so must be expunged.

They are very clear. This lone chair threatens the existence of a multi-million dollar assisted living facility, closure of which will result in the unemployment of thirty staff and the expulsion of two hundred residents onto the streets. We wouldn't want that, *would we*

Only mentioned as a side note is the extermination inflicted on this chair. Like a trip through hell, it was heated to 200 degrees. (Bedbugs die at 115 degrees). I am searching for the related greek myth of the story of the hero who has a godly advocate but must pass through the gates of hell before they are redeemed.

We have sat in this chair for a week with no bites. There are no bedbugs. We decide to ignore administration's warning.

It is only a week later when I am stopped in the hall. Our diligent building supervisor helpfully informs me if I will load the chair on one of the dollys, he will be glad to remove it. He is polite, but this is unmistakeably not a request. The chair must fulfill its destiny, we may not intervene on its behalf.

I have a picture of my sleeping mother-in-law in this chair. She is covered with a colorful afghan and has an angelic smile. The chair is at peace, it is fulfilling a destiny. In good conscience, I cannot stand by and allow it to be destroyed.

But how?

## Hidden Fugitive

We cannot ignore administration. They have clearly stated their intent and are motivated to make good on their threat.
