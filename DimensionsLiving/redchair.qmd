## Flotsom

American ghosts are vengeful, horrifying entities. 

Unless you are christian, in which case they are holy. 

Personally, I think what we call ghosts are echoes of our lives. Some of these echoes are formal and intentional:  tombstones, memorials, buildings, statues. Some are transitory and mysterious: a sense of being watched, sounds in the house, objects disappearing and reappearing, conversations in dreams. Some are simply the pressure of things we leave behind: clothing, fishing rods, photos, creamtion ashes, toothbrushes, facebook accounts, possessions, furniture.

Our apartment at dimensions living includes access to a security cage for large or dirty items. It's located in the basement, next to a large collection of wheelchairs, walkers, assistive toilet devices, and easy lift recliners. I assume these were left behind by former residents. Former, as in *moved on*. I haven't dug for the history, but I suspect these items are no longer of use to the previous owner or their children.

This flotsom rests in an uninteresting pile in a poorly lit and unswept corner of the garage. There's not enough dramatic lighting, creepy features, or ominous soundtrack to warrant hauntings. Nobody comes down here except to drive their cars.

This is where we met the red chair.

## Theft of the red chair

Amidst the walkers and wheelchairs is a red, leather, La-Z-Boy recliner. It is in perfect condition, no rips or worn-through patches. This chair has a large wood lever on the right side to control the extension of the footrest. Lean back in the chair and it expands to your length. Move to sit upright or stand and it will fold out of the way. It is designed to make you comfortable; this is why it exists. This chair knows the how and why of existence without the benefit of microprocessor or bluetooth connection.

The only wear-and-tear is a discolored area corresponding to the position of the owner's head. The arm rests on the chair are also slightly faded. It's easy to see how it has cradled a sleeping senior, late night television supplying unwatched light and unheard sound. Both chair and owner rest peacefully until one morning the owner neglects to greet the morning. The apartment is cleaned, nobody wants the chair, and it is hauled to the basement. For the chair, this is the opposite of the balloon layer.

I'm told not everyone knows about the balloon layer. How sad. If you are a parent or grandparent or aunt or uncle, you will need to know this. Give a child a helium balloon. If you don't tie it to their wrist, they will accidentally release it. The expression on a child watching a balloon sail into the distance is photogenic, but distressing. Tears and wailing will ensue. 

This is an opportunity to inform the child about the balloon layer. All balloons aspire to join their fellow balloons in this glorious place, but they are held captive in the mortal layer until a child releases them. How grateful the balloon is and how happy this child might be, knowing they have dispensed charity to a simple balloon. 

It's a nice story, but if the child is quick, they will realize this is an opportunity for a vast magnanomous guesture by purchasing ALL of the balloons and releasing them from their captivity. Or they may race about the playground, freeing balloons from the clutches of less-informed peers.

Back to the red chair.

Janell (my wife) and I stand in the basement and consider the chair. Whatever echoes the owner of the chair has left behind finds us and whisper a sales pitch. The ghost has an interest in the well being of this favorite chair.  *It's mechanically perfect!* whispers the ghost. The chair behaves like any kennel dog being considered for adoption, straightens it's shoulders and looks at us with a hopeful expression. *It's valued at $1,800 dollars retail.* The chair does its best to hide the dust on its arms and seat. *You need such a chair!*

Janell doesn't hesitate. "Get the dolly, we're taking this chair to our room."

## Not so fast

Building administration knows about this chair. It has a history and a death sentence. The ghost of its previous owner did not mention the bedbug infestation and pending one-way appointment with the dumpster.

If I was the ghost, I might be guilty of a similar omission. We learned this chair was one of a set, its partner had already made the one-way dumpster journey. Our ghost had seen the future and like Marley in *A Christmas Carol* was doing its best to prevent the repeat of that dismal fate. We unknowingly participated in the clandestine rescue of this chair and the relief of the ghost.

Housekeeping ratted us out. They saw the chair and reported its salvation to administration who sent their angels of destruction to warn us of our offenses. We must return the chair to suffer its undeserved fate. The certification of assisted living facilities does not allow bedbugs; this chair was once infested and so must be expunged.

They are very clear about this chair. And it is unfair to paint administration as the villian in this story. This lone chair threatens the existence of a multi-million dollar assisted living facility, closure of which will result in the unemployment of thirty staff and the expulsion of two hundred residents onto the streets. They are doing their best given the constraints of state licensing guidelines and the boundaries of good common sense.

Only mentioned as a side note is the extermination procedure inflicted on this chair. Like a trip through hell, it was heated to 200 degrees. (Bedbugs die at 115 degrees). I am searching for the related greek myth of the story of the hero who has a godly advocate but must pass through the gates of hell before they are redeemed.

We have sat in this chair for five days with no bites. There are no bedbugs. We decide to ignore administration's warning.

It is only a week later when I am stopped in the hall. Our diligent building supervisor helpfully informs me if I will load the chair on one of the dollys, he will be glad to remove it. He is polite, but this is unmistakeably not a request. The chair must fulfill its destiny, we may not intervene on its behalf. *Bedbugs. State regulations. Employment. Your monther's best interests...*

I have a picture of my sleeping mother-in-law in this chair. She is covered with a colorful afghan and has an angelic smile. The chair is at peace, it is fulfilling a destiny. In good conscience, I cannot stand by and allow it to be destroyed.

But how?

## Hidden Fugitive

We cannot ignore administration. They have clearly stated their intent and are motivated to make good on their threat. The chair must go.

In the corner of our apartment stands the ghost and the chair, looking at us with hopeful eyes. 

What to do?
What to do.

Enter Jon, my college roommate. He collects old cars and stray dogs. Actually his wife collects dogs, Jon just collects cars. Dogs and old cars are alike in many ways, except maintenance of the dogs is a fraction of that of the old cars. Jon enters this story with two important assets: he is nearby, and he stores cars in a barn.

A *barn*...

I wrap the chair in plastic and load it into the back of my Honda CR-V, then show up at Jon's with the chair and a six-pack of good beer. I leave with neither. I assure him I will return in a month, reload the chair into the CR-V and transport it to my home in Portland, Oregon. Jon has experienced many years of my unpredictable antics, but agrees to cooperate. Problem solved!

Our apartment is void of the chair. We invite housekeeping to survey the residence. Everything is as it should be.

Only...there are four depressions in the carpet where the chair briefly resided. An echo.

## An unintended return

Three weeks later we are invited to Jon's home of rambunctious dogs and slumbering cars. Also attending is a gaggle of college roommates. Beer is consumed and old stories are embellished. Sometime between our arrival and the departure of common sense, we decide to move a truck topper from an unmowed patch to an unkempt room in the barn. This is performed in the same manner as pallbearers carrying a coffin to a grave. It's probable this topper won't move from this resting place for many years--normal for objects in a barn.

Janell doesn't participate in the ceremonial transfer of the topper, but she does observe the final placement of the topper. I may not have mentioned this is within eyesight of the chair.

Janell was not in favor of moving the chair to Jon's barn. This was my doing and she unwillingly allowed it to happen. But it is clear she sides with the ghost and the chair, making it three-to-one in favor of the chair residing in front of the television, rather than supplying mice and pigeons a resting and spawning facility.

When I place my corner of the topper in the barn, I turn to observe the ghost and the Janell observing the chair.

"I'm getting the CR-V," they say. Janell is the vocal member of the triad, so she speaks in the singular. "We're loading this up and taking it back." I'm unclear who is the "we" in this sentence, but it will inescapably include me as part of the lift team. I am also included in the unload team, the dolly team, and the return of the chair team.

The return of this chair means we must banish housekeeping, We need to scrub our own toilet and vacuum our own carpet. It is a small inconvenience considering the comfort of the chair, and the pleasure of employing the chair as a platform for evening television.

## New home, same skill

At the end of our stay at Dimensions Living, we loaded the chair in the CR-V and drove 1,945 miles to our home in Portland, Oregon. The chair is a good traveler: doesn't require too many bathroom breaks, doesn't shed or bark, is willing to listen to whatever music or audiobook we choose, doesn't cost extra when we stay at hotels. We have piled other things on top of it, again with no complaints.

The ghost is also a good traveler, but I do sense its presence. Especially now that the chair resides in our living room, the ghost also hovers about.

## Final resting place

The chair seems to be content. It fulfills its purpose with pleasure, wrapping itself around anyone needing to rest. I'm not so sure about the ghost.

What do you do when you've fulfilled a task? Janell and I have invested almost three-quarters of a year attending to Greta's rehabilitation and socialization. This could go on for years before we no longer make a difference in her life. Then what?

Janell and I have retired. End of a task. But then? I continue to teach and Janell finds new pursuits. We assume those tasks will end when we die, but I sense the presence of a ghost, satisfied with the disposition of its chair, but now moving to his next play.
