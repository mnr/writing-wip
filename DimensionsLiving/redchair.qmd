## Flotsam

We all create ghostly echoes. Some echoes are formal and intentional: tombstones, memorials, buildings, statues. Some are transitory and mysterious: your sense of being watched, strange sounds in the house, objects disappearing and reappearing, dreams of conversations with the deceased. Some are the pressure of things we leave behind: clothing, fishing rods, photos, cremation ashes, toothbrushes, Facebook accounts, furniture.

Our apartment at Dimensions Living includes access to a security cage for large items. It's in the basement parking garage, next to a disordered pile of wheelchairs, walkers, assistive toilet devices, and easy lift recliners. I assume former residents left these behind. Former, as in *moved on*. I haven't dug for the history, but I suspect these are no longer useful to the previous owners or their children.

This flotsam rests in an uninteresting pile in an unswept corner of the garage. There's no dramatic lighting, creepy features, or ominous soundtrack to warn of a haunting. Nobody comes down here except to retrieve their cars.

This is where I meet the red chair.

## Theft of the red chair

On one of my trips to the security cage, I wander over to the flotsam pile. Amidst the walkers and wheelchairs in the basement is a red leather La-Z-Boy recliner. It is in perfect condition, no rips or worn-through patches. The chair has a large wood lever to control the footrest. Lean back and it unfolds to a horizontal position. Move to sit upright and it folds to a normal chair shape. Its purpose is to make you comfortable; this is why it exists.

The only wear and tear is a discolored area corresponding to the previous owner's head and faded areas on the armrests. Echoes of a past life.

It's easy to see how the chair cradled its owner; late night television supplying unwatched light and unheard sound. Both chair and owner rested peacefully until that one morning when the owner did not greet the sunrise. Maintenance cleaned the apartment, nobody wanted the chair, so they hauled it downstairs.

Janell (my wife) and I now stand before that chair.

The ghost of the chair's owner whispers a sales pitch. The ghost has an interest in the well being of this favorite chair.

"*It's mechanically perfect,*" says the ghost.

The chair behaves like any kennel dog being considered for adoption, straightens its shoulders and looks at us with a hopeful expression.

"*It's valued at \$1,800 retail,*" says the ghost.

The chair does its best to hide the dust on its arms and seat.

"*You need such a chair!*" concludes the ghost.

Janell doesn't hesitate. "Get the cart; we're taking this upstairs."

## Not so fast

Building Administration knows about this chair. It has a history and a death sentence. The ghost doesn't mention the bedbug infestation and appointment with a dumpster.

If I were the ghost, I might make a similar omission. From the staff, we learn this chair was one of a set; they had disposed of its partner. Our ghost had seen the future and---like Marley in *A Christmas Carol*---is doing its best to prevent the repeat of that fate. We unknowingly take part in the clandestine rescue of this chair.

Housekeeping rats us out. They see the chair in our apartment and reported its salvation to Administration which sends their angels of destruction. Their message is final. We must return the chair to suffer its demise. The certification of assisted living facilities does not allow bedbugs; this chair is a carrier and so must be expunged.

It is unfair to paint Administration as the villain in this story. This lone chair threatens the existence of a multi-million dollar senior care facility, closure of which will cause the unemployment of thirty staff and the expulsion of two hundred residents onto the streets. They do their best, given the constraints of state licensing guidelines and the boundaries of good common sense. The chair is an innocent victim of government regulation.

Missing from this drama is the actual presence of bedbugs. To sanitize the chair, Maintence heats it to 200 degrees---bedbugs die at 115 degrees. Like a Greek hero, the chair passes through the gates of hell to gain redemption.

We have sat in this chair for five days with no bites. There are no bedbugs. We ignore Administration's warning.

It is only a week later when I am stopped in the hall. Our building supervisor informs me that if I load the chair on a dolly, he will be glad to remove it. He is polite, but this is not a suggestion. The chair must be destroyed; we may not intervene on its behalf. *Bedbugs. State regulations. Employment.*

I have a photograph of my sleeping mother-in-law in this chair. She is tucked in with a colorful afghan and has an angelic smile. The chair is at peace; it is fulfilling a destiny. In good conscience I cannot stand by and allow it to be destroyed.

But how?

## Hidden Fugitive

We cannot ignore Administration. They have stated their intent. The chair must go.

In the corner of our apartment stand the ghost and the chair, looking at us with hopeful eyes.

What to do? What to do.

Enter Jon, my college roommate. He collects old cars and stray dogs. Actually, his wife collects dogs, Jon just collects cars. Dogs and old cars are alike except maintenance of the dogs is a fraction of that of the cars. Jon enters this story with two important assets: he is nearby, and he stores cars in a barn. *Wait*---A *barn*!

I wrap the chair in plastic and load it into my car, then show up at Jon's with the chair and a six-pack of beer. I leave with neither. I assure him I will return in a month, retrieve the chair and transport it to my home. Jon has experienced many years of my unpredictable antics, but agrees to cooperate. Problem solved!

Our apartment is devoid of the chair. We invite Housekeeping to survey the residence. Everything is as it should be.

Only...there are four depressions in the carpet where it stood. An echo.

## An unintended return

Three weeks later Jon invites us to his home of rambunctious dogs and slumbering cars. Also attending is a frolic of former college roommates. Beer is consumed and old stories are embellished. Sometime between our arrival and the departure of common sense, we decide to move a truck topper from an unmowed patch to an unkempt room in the barn. We perform this like pallbearers carrying a coffin to a grave. It's probable this topper won't travel from this resting place for many years---normal for objects in a barn.

Janell doesn't take part in the transport, but she observes the final placement of the topper; within eyesight of the chair.

Janell is not pleased about moving the chair to Jon's barn. This is my doing, and she unwillingly allows it to happen. But it is clear she sides with the ghost and the chair, making it three-to-one in favor of the chair residing in front of the television, rather than supplying mice and pigeons a resting and spawning facility.

I finish with the truck topper and turn to see the ghost and Janell considering the chair.

"I'm getting the car," they say. Janell is the vocal member of the triad, so she speaks in the singular. "We're loading this up and taking it back." I'm unclear who is the "we" in this sentence, but it will include me as part of the lift team. I am also included in the unload team, the dolly team, and the elevator team.

The return of this chair means we must banish Housekeeping. We need to scrub our own toilet and vacuum our own carpet. It is a slight inconvenience considering the comfort of the chair and the pleasure of employing it as a comfort station for evening television.

## New home, same skill

At the end of our stay at Dimensions Living, we transport the chair 1,945 miles to our home in Portland, Oregon. The chair is a good traveler: doesn't require bathroom breaks, doesn't shed or bark, will listen to whatever music or audiobook we choose, and doesn't cost extra when we stop at hotels. Positioned in our living room, the chair fulfills its purpose with pleasure, wrapping itself around anyone willing to pause long enough for a pre-bedtime nap.

My younger son, Aaron, came for a visit the other day. He had already heard the rumor of the red chair and the history of bedbugs. He experienced his own bedbug episode which resulted in the dumpsterizing of his leather overstuffed lounger.

Aaron regards the red chair much the same way you might regard a road-kill deer dragged into the living room.

"So," he said. He stands somewhat leaned back, hands in pockets. He raises one eyebrow. "This is the chair?"

The chair straightens its shoulders and looks at Aaron with a hopeful expression.

"It's mechanically perfect!" I say. "It's valued at \$1,800 retail. We need such a chair!"

Aaron isn't convinced, and his posture doesn't change. The chair looks from Aaron to me, hoping for reassurance I'll protect it. I pat the back of the chair; no worries, nobody is taking it to the dumpster.

## Ghosts

Janell and I are considering downsizing to a smaller house. We don't need furniture for two guest rooms; we don't need a table to seat eight; we don't want a lawnmower, and we don't need a couch and four lounge chairs to watch television. But I'm certain we will still need a red chair. I'm uncertain we have a voice in the decision. The chair is with us until we find it a new home to the ghost's liking. Until then, the chair is in our living room.

I take great comfort knowing a chair can have a spiritual guardian. If something as insignificant as a mass-produced piece of furniture is cared for, then what about me? Or you? I can only hope for such an advocate when I have bedbugs and become destined for disposal.
