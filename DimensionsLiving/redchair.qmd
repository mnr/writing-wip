## Flotsom

American ghosts are vengeful, horrifying entities. Unless you are christian, in which case they are holy. Personally, I think we leave echoes of our lives. Some of these are formal and intentional:  tombstones, memorials, buildings, libraries, or Facebook accounts. Some are transitory and mysterious: being watched, sounds in the house, objects disappearing and reappearing, conversations in dreams. Some are simply the collective pressure of things we leave behind: clothing, fishing rods, photos, creamtion ashes, toothbrushes.

Along with our apartment, we were given a security cage for large or dirty items. It's located in the basement, next to a large collection of wheelchairs, walkers, assistive toilet devices, and easy lift recliners. I assume these were left behind by former residents. Former, as in *moved on*. I haven't dug for answers, but I suspect these are no longer of use to the previous owner or their children.

These are in an unsightly pile in a dark and dusty part of the garage. There's not enough dramatic lighting and creepy features to warrant hauntings. Nobody comes down here except to drive off with their cars. The flotsom sits in an uninteresting pile of uninteresting devices.

Except...the red chair.
