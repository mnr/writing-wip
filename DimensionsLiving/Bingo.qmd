## Nickel Bingo in the IDR

Consider this listing in the weekly event guide:

> *Nickel Bingo Every Thursday Night at 6:00 p.m.*

There are two notable things about this sentence. Least of the two, but still significant, is the time: activities occurring past 5:00 p.m. are considered *late-evening*. ~~Dinner~~ Supper is served from 4:30 to 5:30 p.m.; past that time the halls become the turf of the night owls. Any resident gatherings after six p.m. are surreptitious. Walk unannounced into one of the activity rooms and you may find residents quietly playing Rummikub, but that's just to avert suspicion; when you move out of earshot, they will return to plotting world domination.

Previous to living here, these late-night residents would have huddled around the corner table in a seedy bar, speaking in lowered voices and pausing their negotiations when the waitress comes by to refill drinks.

At six o'clock, the sharks circle the waters of my residence hall. At six o'clock on Thursday evenings, the sharks forego Rummikub and swim to the Independent Dining Room for *nickel bingo*.

## Nickel Bingo

Nickel Bingo is the second of notable things in the above sentence. There are *other* bingo games during the week, but candy bingo and jewelry bingo are minor-league compared to nickel bingo. The bingo sharks occasionally participate, but only as a side to the big event on Thursday evening. If you win at candy or jewelry bingo, you get to choose a piece of candy (or a piece of jewelry). But, *you don't have to put anything in the cup to play*. For these lessor games, you can show up empty-handed and still win. Not so with nickel bingo.

Very few men participate in candy or jewelry bingo. I have asked the activities coordinators if there is ever gun bingo, fishing lure bingo, or whiskey bingo. (answer: *no!*) I'd like to organize an underground bingo association for the men, and the poorly-lit basement parking garage would be ideal for a cigar-smoking, whiskey-drinking, Friday night game. So far, I have abstained from instigating. I don't want to be the cause (or subject) of an *official memo* on appropriate evening activities.

## Official Memos

Official memos come from the Facility Director. They are copied on letterhead and appear in your campus mail slot. The instigating resident or precipitating situation is only vaguely insinuated, but the intent is clear: *"Keep it up, buster, and your children will be interviewing other residence halls for your next placement."*

## Bingo Basics

The essentials of the game of bingo are necessary if you hope to understand the drama associated with nickel bingo. I'll make this as brief as possible, after which I'll explain why bingo frequently descends into mayhem.

Simply explained, each bingo player possesses a bingo card displaying a printed matrix of random numbers. The caller sits in front and announces a series of random numbers. When a called number matches a number on the player card, the player marks this position in the matrix. When the marked positions on a bingo card align in a pattern (such as a complete row or column) the player calls out "BINGO." Assuming all the player numbers match caller numbers, the player is a winner. Everyone calls out in amazement and the game is reset.

The random numbers called out are traditionally generated with a bucket of numbered balls, although some callers use computer programs. With the bucket-of-balls approach, the caller shuffles the balls (either by hand in a bucket or with a tumbler cage), retrieves a ball, then reads the value printed on the ball. Computer applications select a random number at the push of a button, then display it on screen. An internet search will turn up several versions for all phones and computers.

Until recently I did not understand there are different types of bingo. The number of balls used to generate random numbers can vary from thirty to ninety. The rows and columns on the cards, when multiplied, can equal as few as nine positions and as many as twenty-five. Where I live, we play American bingo; seventy-five balls for random number generation and the players use cards with a five-by-five matrix of integers. Each column is topped by the letters of "BINGO." The center square is marked as "FREE."

Your bingo card is randomly selected from a stack. I don't believe you are allowed to bring your own card, although I haven't tried. At the least, it would be a topic of conversation for weeks and might even be the cause of an *official memo*.

Our bingo cards are environmentally-friendly; each number appears in a window with a sliding, transparent-red piece of plastic. When a number is called, you slide the plastic down. When the game is over, you slide the plastic to the top of each window and prepare for the next round. With age, these plastic sliders become sticky and reticent to move. I haven't found any maintenance instructions for these cards but later today I'm going to test WD-40. I've tried to disassemble a card for better access to the internals but like carburetors and mobile phones, I don't have the correct proprietary tool and my numerous attempts have only resulted in fewer operational bingo cards.

When I am less engaged, my mind wanders through the wonderful math of the game. There are algorithmic rules for the placement of numbers on the board. Each column has a range of discrete integers, each integer can only appear once, the integers must be random in value and occurrence.

I shared my rapture with Janell and she gave me a look I have received only once before. In that case, I had excitedly discussed my progress on creating an etch-a-sketch program for the Apple IIe computer, written in assembler. At the time, we were dirt-poor and she failed to see how this could be a career-enhancing pursuit. (Side note: It was career enhancing)

As much as I would like to inflict a comprehensive discussion of the programming necessary to generate the bingo matrix, I realize the audience for this sort of thing is limited. Instead, I have added an appendix with code to create a proper bingo card. You're welcome.

## The Player Table

This crowd has unofficially agreed on assigned seating, although there was an *official memo* to the contrary. I advise visitors to sit at a table in the periphery of the room to avoid crashing the normal order; even then, you may find yourself crowding in as the fifth at a table of four. Maybe you should consider just watching, rather than disrupting the clean geometry of two bingo cards per side of the table.

Assuming you've found a place to sit, picture yourself at a table with three friends. In front of each of you are two bingo cards. (You could play more, but two seems to be the accepted norm. And I strongly advise you to stick to the accepted norm).

To play nickel bingo, you'll need a jar of nickels. Quarters, dimes, pennies, and even dollar bills will suffice, but, as you will see, non-nickels cause unnecessary confusion. For God's sake, don't bring foreign currency. Again, probable cause for an *official memo*.

In the middle of the table is a small bowl. It might be empty or it might contain change. If you want to play this round of bingo (and you do, or you wouldn't be sitting at the table) you must contribute one nickel per bingo card. Two bingo cards, two nickels. Four people at the table times two bingo cards will result in eight nickels in the bowl. Which equals forty cents. Instead of two nickels, you are allowed to deposit one dime. If you deposit a quarter, you can remove fifteen cents from the bowl.

Before you remove money from the bowl, be *inordinately* clear about your action and intention. Sudden movement near the group nickel bowl can be misconstrued.

## Game Phase One-The Collection

Before each round of bingo can begin, the designated money collector circulates among the tables and gathers the contents of each bowl. It's assumed the money collector confirms each table has contributed the correct amount. This collection is then placed at the head table and the bingo caller can proceed.

*But not so fast...*

You might think the task of money collector is inconsequential, but it is not. An informal and self-designated sub-committee of bingo sharks bestows the honor of money collector upon an individual. The qualifications are not available for public review anywhere that I've seen, but I believe squeezing between tightly-packed tables is an essential skill. This requires the ability to bend your knees and locomote without the assistance of a walker or wheelchair. I am proud to note I personally have been asked to perform this task and have discharged my duties with the earnestness of a first-time student council president.

The task of collecting bingo fees must be done with efficiency; the game is, after all, delayed until this is completed. The sharks are waiting, but not patiently. Pick up the bowl, count the change. This should be simple enough.

*However*. What is the proper response if the change is not correct for the number of bingo cards visible on the table?

Your first strategy might be to ask if everyone has contributed their two nickels. If you're fortunate, one member of the table will realize it is time to ante-up and contribute their fair share. Unfortunately, this rarely happens.

There are two complexities to consider, possibly more. For example, this table may be assuming that nickels are placed in the cup *after* the money collector has emptied the bowl for the current round. This is an advanced bingo shark technique. Speaking from personal experience, it is easy to become confused about the state of the bowl and you would be mistaken to blame this on any of the seven stages of dementia.

It's also possible there is a change-making anomaly, usually indicated by the presence of a quarter in the bowl and exacerbated by the cumulative arthritis of everyone at the table. Arthritis is when your knuckles grind bone-on-bone. To develop empathy, I suggest you insert 60-grit sandpaper between each joint in your fingers so it is excruciating to bend them, then wrap each finger in duct-tape so you are unable to flex. Now pick up three nickels placed in a small bowl to make change for your quarter.

During your training to become certified as a bingo money collector, you'll also learn of the inadvertent bowl collection confusion. Here's a scenario:

1.  Arrive at the table. Develop empathy with the sharks at this table. Assure them they will win during this round.

2.  Someone will need change, most likely for a dollar. Happily count out nickels from the bingo fees you've already collected. Exchange those nickels for the dollar.

3.  Reach to collect the bowl from the table. In some cases, someone will object; "You've already collected for this round."

You may think you are *certain* you have not collected. But you are only one vote out of five, the other four being the players seated at the table. They may be assuming the bowl contains money for the next round. The act of making change may have interrupted the normal flow of the interaction between sharks and collectors. Or sadly, there may be some dementia and short-term memory is a bit wobbly.

Untangling an error in cash flow is tortuous. You might choose to reason through a narrative of the collection but you have no written proof. It's easiest to do as I do and just agree everything is accurate, then pour this bowl into the general collection. This isn't an IRS audit, there is no audit trail, the amount you win is secondary to the win itself. Smile and move on. After all, it's only forty cents.

At times, someone may be unable to contribute or is somehow flustered with the quick flow of money across the table. I've learned to carry a supplemental pocket of nickels and make a lightning loan where necessary. *"I've got you covered,"* I tell my new friend. Everyone usually forgets about the loan, but the friendship remains.

## Game Phase Two-The Calling

After money is collected, the bingo caller can proceed with the announcement of the numbers. Again, let me explain the simple concept, then I'll explain the nuances that lead to shouting.

To call bingo, you have a bucket of numbered balls. In American bingo, you'll have seventy-five balls. Each ball also shows a letter, one of "B", "I", "N", "G", or "O." The letters are non-essential, but assist with the location of the numbers on the bingo card. For example, numbers one through fifteen always appear in the first column, which is labeled "B". Numbers sixteen through thirty always appear in the second column, which is labeled with "I." A typical call would be something to the effect of "G-48." Number forty-eight, if it appears on your bingo card, will always appear in the fourth column, which is labeled with a "G."

If a caller were to announce "N-18" there would be shouting. If you are ever asked to call bingo, don't try this. The sharks understand the numbering system. Do it twice and you will lose your bingo caller certification.

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Bingo Caller Certification

You might think I am kidding about bingo caller certification. I am not. Depending on your state of residence, you may be required to take a class, pass a test, and/or annually renew your license. Search the internet for *bingo certification* for details.
:::

So. The caller will reach into the bucket, withdraw a ball, announce the letter/number combination, then-and this is important-place the ball in the correct place in a master matrix with seventy-five depressions. Each hole is numbered and arranged in five columns of fifteen rows. Each column is labeled with one letter from the word "BINGO." With the ball safely in place, withdraw another ball and repeat the process. The master matrix is an easy way to confirm which numbers have been called. Which is really important when someone calls...

**BINGO!**

### What could possibly go wrong?

Before we get to the climax of the evening, let's discuss the reality of a live bingo game in the context of a simplified communication model. There are many models; we'll just consider the sender, noise, and the receiver.

#### Sender

Qualities of a good bingo caller - the sender, in this discussion - include enunciation, volume, and pacing - much like an auctioneer, but slower. There is such a thing as lightning bingo-but not where I live.

Ideally, the bingo caller will draw a ball from the bucket, then pause to look at the letter/number on the ball, call out the number clearly and carefully, pause, repeat the letter/number, place the ball in the master matrix, pause, shuffle the balls, and draw the next ball.

However, some callers have forgotten their training and acquire bad habits: Speaking softly. Sloppy pronunciation. Caling too fast. When auditioning a caller, you might consider past experience as pastor, square-dance caller, sports announcer, elementary school teacher, or game-show host. Unfortunately, the qualification of the caller is not the only chaotic force in action

Pacing is every bit as important as volume and enunciation. If your brain is less than seventy years old, you probably don't have empathy for the reduction in processing speed as we age. When I was twenty-years-old, I could do polynomial equations in my head. I could also perform deep-knee bends while lifting seventy-pound weights. Forty years later, math takes longer, just like my knees support less. Pausing between numbers gives everyone a chance to hear the number, parse the number, check both bingo cards, slide the plastic cover on a number, reslide the cover if it sticks, confirm the number with a neighbor, check for a bingo pattern, and re-focus in preparation for the next number.

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Polynomial Equations

This is an example of a simple polynomial equation: $x^2 + 2x +5$

This is a complex polynomial equation: $a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$

Quickly solve for $x$ . Good luck...
:::

Imagine if I called out polynomial equations at the pace of one per minute. You might solve the first one. Possibly the second. By the third you would be calling for a pause, and by the fourth you would be irretrievably lost and complaining to your table-mates. Madness and shouting would ensue.

#### Noise

Communication models include the channel of transmission (paper for writing, copper wires for phone calls, air for sound) and include noise as a complicating factor. Smeared ink for paper, static for phone calls, and rattling bingo balls for bingo callers.

About those damn bingo balls. They are plastic; every time you stir the bucket of balls, you generate noise akin to a ball-bearing factory. It effectively masks human speech. Don't stir the balls while you are calling a number. If you don't pause long enough between calling the number and stirring the balls, you get the following...

> "O-63...that's O-(RATTLERATTLERATTLE). The next number is B-3. That's B-(RATTLERATTLERATTLE)."

RATTLERATTLERATTLE results in secondary fallout noise, caused by one or more calls to repeat the last number, followed by 25% of the bingo players repeating the number (out of sync, so the response is also confused) followed by the bingo caller demanding silence, which is followed by another 25% of bingo players again asserting the latest number simultaneous to a different 25% asking if it was a different number, followed by the caller repeating the number, followed by someone asking if that is the last number or the next number. At this time, there is background rumbling about the caller being inaudible or the players needing to pay better attention. I suspect this is the reason why we cannot retain bingo callers for more than a couple of months.

Also problematic is the arrival of outsiders: relatives, children, nursing staff, janitors. Relatives and children are the worst as they have no respect for the sanctity of the game in progress. Typically, they appear at the door of the bingo parlor, squeal and call out; "Grandma! We're here!" They invade en-masse, surround their relative and talk loudly about their *car trip* and *how good it is to see them* and *how big the kids have grown* and *we have this pie we baked for you* and *what's going on here* and *Oh, I love bingo* and *we should join in*.

I'm enthusiastic about visitors. They brighten up everyone's day. But *gawdammit*, we're trying to play **bingo** here. ***Nickel Bingo!***

Likewise, the nursing staff are heroes and wrangle medications and blood pressures with grace and care. But the brief interruption in game play means possibly missed numbers, causing one or more calls to repeat the last number, followed by 25% of the bingo players repeating the number ... and so on.

If maintenance is backed up, they may try to vacuum in the next room. The white noise masks the bingo caller's voice, players won't be able to hear, one or more calls to repeat the last number ... and further so on and so forth.

#### Receiver

If the caller enunciates, projects, and paces-and someone's kid isn't playing with a vacuum cleaner or generating some other form of white noise, then it is reasonable to assume everything will go smoothly. However, there is still the matter of the receiver-the bingo player, in this scenario.

By age 80, it's not uncommon to have hearing loss of 50% in the frequency range of the human voice. Roughly one-third of the bingo players have some level of Alzheimers, one of the symptoms of that disease being confusion and agitation when dealing with the cacophony of many people talking at once.

Did you solve the polynomials shown above? Solve them again while teaching an elementary band class. Or coaching the high school homecoming football game. These are both good examples of cacophony as applied to bingo.

By the way, good tablemates look out for each other. After scanning your own bingo cards, stealthily scan your neighbor's cards and politely point out any numbers they may have missed. Done quietly, this is a gesture of kindness.

## Game Phase Three-BINGO

**BINGO!**

It eventually happens. Sometimes you hear it from another table. Sometimes from your own table. Sometimes you double-take at your own card, realize you have the game pattern and you hear yourself yell **BINGO**.

In American bingo, there are three basic winning patterns: Five in a row, five in a column, and five diagonally. Where I live, there are two additional patterns: Four corners, and the climatic *blackout*. (more about blackout in a minute) Some callers will try additional patterns (i.e picture frame, postage stamp, two lines, small diamond) but approval among the sharks has been mixed.

Upon hearing bingo, the caller pauses the game.

An experienced caller will remind players *not* to clear their board in case a bingo isn't confirmed. An inexperienced caller will forget this step and players will clear their boards. If a bingo is not confirmed, the confusion quotient of the room will rise. A player whom mistakenly cleared their board will request a re-call of all the drawn numbers, but that takes time and is not a popular suggestion. By the way, not clearing your bingo card until confirmation is an earmark of an experienced player. If you wait until confirmation, congratulations, you are on your way to bingo sharkdom.

Confirming a bingo is mechanically easy but can be problematic. If everything runs smoothly, the winning player reads out-loud the numbers comprising their bingo, the caller confirms those numbers were actually called and if all goes well, the caller confirms a winning bingo. Nickels are distributed to the winner and everyone resets their bingo cards.

As in all steps of bingo, problems appear during the implementation. The concept of "out loud" has various interpretations with variables including speed of delivery and volume of the player. Here's a scenario: I call out a random set of five numbers between one and seventy-five. I can do this as quickly and as softly as I want. (for example, *8-16-Free-57-72*. "Free" because this is the middle row) I might include the corresponding B-I-N-G-O letters.

As caller, your job is to check those numbers against a matrix of balls used to generate the calls. Maybe your hearing isn't as good as it used to be. Maybe other players are chatting/gossiping/remarking at how close *they* were at winning. Maybe your memory for numbers isn't as good as it used to be, or in my case I can barely remember my own phone number after practicing for five years much less remember your phone number or a random set of five numbers without writing them down.

Confirming a bingo often takes multiple tries. But in the end (usually) everything works out and we have a winner.

### Blackout Bingo

Each evening bingo session includes ten rounds with the standard row/column/diagonal bingo pattern. As mentioned above, these games cost one nickel per card. There is an additional, final round which uses a blackout pattern. If you are participating, be aware the cost per card doubles to *ten cents per card*. Where you put down five cents per card time two cards per player times four players per table (equals forty cents) you now put down *ten* cents per card (equals *eighty* cents per table). Our bingo room has space for seven tables, so winning blackout bingo is a big payout!

Blackout bingo means you cover all the spots on a card. This takes a bit longer than standard patterns, but the suspense is *killer*! Several times I've felt my blood pressure rising as I watch the card shift to red. Several times I've had only two, maybe one window open. Several times my fantasy of big payout has been crushed by someone else calling **BINGO**. *Dammit!*

## Game Phase Four-PAYOUT

So - you've won bingo! This is the time to do a victory dance, beat your chest, throw your winning bingo card across the room and shout "**I DOMINATE! I AM THE BINGO JEDI MASTER! COWER IN FEAR, ALL WHO BEHOLD ME!**"

Actually, don't do that. First, your knees are probably not up to dancing around, beating your chest is *not* advised if you've had any history of heart trouble, throwing anything across the room is likely to poke someone's eye out, and honestly, your voice at 65+ years of age just isn't as impressive as it might have been when you were 20. (The above should be read in a faster-than-normal voice used by TV announcers at the end of a miracle drug ad with multiple adverse side effects.)

When you win, revel in the momentary endorphin rush of seeing a pile of change pour into your bingo change jar, tell your table friends how much fun that was and how surprised you are to have won. Then get ready for the next round.

### Two or More Winners

Most bingo is won by a single person, but it's not uncommon for two (or more) people to simultaneously win bingo. (The odds of winning bingo is a fascinating subject if you are a statistician or math professor. Look it up on the internet if you're interested. The rest of us should leave the math geeks in peace).

When multiple **BINGO!**s are confirmed, the winnings are split. There are three strategies used to accomplish this split.

-   Total, then count. Add up all the change. Divide by the number of winners. Count out a pile for each winner.

-   Drag into piles. One for you. One for me. Repeat until all coins are distributed.

-   Eyeball. Hmm...this pile looks about this big. Some for you and some for you.

There's a secret I learned in Bingo Collecting School, and I'll only tell you this if you promise not to make a big damn deal about it.

Here's the secret: Where I live, *Nobody cares!*

Divide up the money in mostly equal piles then distribute to the winners. You'll pour that money into a pouch or jar already containing an uncounted amount of change; there is no accounting trail or software involved. The thrill of the win is what counts. Delaying the start of the next game is a buzzkill.

## Final Thoughts

I play bingo with my friends. Some of them are losing their memory and reasoning and physical dexterity. All of them are getting older. Bingo is a opportunity to do something together.

When I grew up, my family played cards so your hands had something to do while you talked. Games were a second act after family meals; we enjoyed hanging out together (most of the time) and we needed some sort of excuse to do so.

(needs more here)

## Appendix

Here is R code to build an American bingo card. R is a programming language used by statisticians and researchers. It is overkill for generating bingo cards, but it's what I'm amused by at this time.

```{r}
gimmeFive <- function(range) {
  as.character(sample(x = range, size = 5))
}

BingoMatrix <- matrix(data = c(gimmeFive(1:15),
                               gimmeFive(16:30),
                               gimmeFive(31:45),
                               gimmeFive(46:60),
                               gimmeFive(61:75)),
                      nrow = 5)

colnames(BingoMatrix) <- c("B","I","N","G","O")

BingoMatrix[3,3] <- "Free"

BingoMatrix
```
