It's shortly after ~~lunch~~ dinner and the independent wing lobby is quiet. The lobby does have its raucous times; Happy hour is here on Fridays at 2:00 p.m. and nickel bingo is Thursday at 6. The weekly activity calendar says there is a town hall meeting today at 2:00 p.m., but right now there are only a few residents checking mail or reading the newspaper.

Outside the picture window is a uncommitted Wisconsin thunderstorm, reluctantly displaying sparse cloud lightning, performing distant rumbling, and dropping intermittent rain.

Other than being asked to refasten Steve's suspenders, I have no pressing tasks. I'm here to write and watch my senior friends. I could write in my room, but the television wants to display important live news and I would be tempted to watch. The independent lobby is more contemplative.

I suppose this place is like a coffee shop, but without the coffee and with less activity. The ventilation system provides white noise and there is just enough muted conversation to keep the silence from becoming oppressive.

Dave exits the lobby elevator. Without looking, I know it's him; he carries a personal rock and roll soundtrack supplied by his iPad. It follows him down the hall like an auditory spirit animal, announcing his arrival and departure.

Last week, I trotted through this space on my way upstairs. The piano in the lobby was occupied by a large man, possibly thirty-five years old. I didn't get his name so we'll call him Alex. Judith, a resident, sat in a chair next to the piano, listening. Alex is a competent pianist, but I couldn't tell how far his talent stretched as he was only playing simple music. The sort of pieces your first piano teacher would give you to practice left and right hand positions, chord changes, and sight reading music.

I intruded and asked if they were mother & son.

"Nope," Alex replied. "I'm just up for a while from Midland, Texas. Judith was my piano teacher when I was in third grade."

"He would stay at my place after school," confirmed Judith. "He ran in the front door, threw his coat on the floor, and made a beeline for the piano. I told him he needed to pick up his coat before he could practice."

Alex played some of the songs Judith had taught him. One of them had words; "Dumbo elephant, dumbo elephant, de-dee-de-dee-de-de dahhh." (I wish I did a better job of writing down the lyrics.) He played chords with his left hand, melody with his right. Judith sang along.

I was an outsider to their reverie and I excused myself. As I walked away, I heard the piano continue. It was a sweet moment.
