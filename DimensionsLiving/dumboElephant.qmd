It's shortly after ~~lunch~~ dinner and the independent wing lobby is quiet. The lobby does have its raucous times; Happy hour is here on Fridays at 2:00 p.m. and nickel bingo is Thursday at 6. The weekly activity calendar says there is a town hall meeting today at 2:00 p.m., but right now there are only a few residents checking mail or reading the newspaper.

Outside the picture window is a uncommitted Wisconsin thunderstorm, reluctantly displaying sparse cloud lightning, performing distant rumbling, and dropping intermittent rain.

Other than being asked to refasten Steve's suspenders, I have no pressing tasks. I'm here to write and watch my senior friends. I could do so in my room, but the television wants to display important live news and I would be tempted to watch. The independent lobby is more contemplative.

Dave exits the lobby elevator. Without looking, I know it's him; he carries a personal soundtrack of country western music supplied by his iPad. It follows him down the hall like an auditory spirit animal, announcing his arrival and departure.

I suppose this place is like a coffee shop, but without the coffee and with less activity. The ventilation system provides white noise and there is just enough muted conversation to keep the silence from becoming oppressive.
