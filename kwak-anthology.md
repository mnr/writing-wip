Two decades after the earthquake, downtown Portland is almost cleared of debris. New buildings rise to optimistic heights and the Willamette river flows to the Columbia. Detective Araci Belo considered the view for a full half-minute, then shifted his focus to the shattered glass. The room he stands in is on the 33rd floor of a luxury condominium built by the city. The hope is to attract business and dispel the perception of Portland as a disaster zone. 

An explosion had propelled bits of the oven from the back of the condominium. Nothing had broken through the window. They were earthquake-proof, designed not to shred the pedestrians below with lethal glass daggers. Despite the cracks and bulls-eyes, they were the most intact feature of this room.

Besides Araci, there were two fire inspectors, a police imaging technician  (“Lupe”), two appliance maintenance people, a building administrator, and her assistant. Three home owners’ association board members and neighbors on all sides of this condo stood in the hallway.

The sweet, meaty smell of burnt flesh emanated from Dakota Williams, the recently deceased occupant of the condominium. She lay on her back in the middle of the room; her severed right arm near the earthquake pillar. Her left forearm leaned against the door. The explosion had burned through her clothing and bits of face, hair, and scalp stuck to the window. 

Araci stepped around Dakota and through the door to other half of the condominium, leading to the bedroom and bath. The bathroom was tidy, but not spotless. There were two toothbrushes in a cup. Before Araci could access the medical records kept by the bathroom mirror, he’d need a privacy waiver. He filed the request, but it would be days before department lawyers could get it cleared.

Araci pulled up Dakota’s publicly shared space, which included pictures of her in Montevideo, always smiling, often in a plaza. In a video dated January 2059, a boy named Robin Lopez appeared. Araci traced Robin back to Portland, Oregon. He had visited Montevideo for an open source software convention. That spring, Dakota boarded a plane to Portland for a long weekend. A month later Robin returned to Montevideo and frolicked at Playa de Los Pocitos in daylight - dancing at night. The videos became more playful and intimate, leading up to Dakota’s move to Portland. 

Araci could request a DNA test, but Robin Lopez surely owned the second toothbrush. His absence in this room was a gaping hole in the narrative. He wasn’t a man of mystery; he had his own complete internet story. But he picked an interesting moment to go missing. Araci made a note to find him.

He attached a summary of Dakota’s history to the case file. She had recently moved from Montevideo, Uruguay, leaving behind an electrical engineer position with a publicly held ransomware company. Her resume listed a current affiliation with “Abundancy,” a non-profit involved in food distribution.

Electronic parts cluttered the small desk; things an electronics engineer might use.

“The scan is ready,” said Officer Guadalupe Reyes. She pushed a few buttons on the back of a camera. “I’ve put the render in the report folder. You interested in grabbing some dinner tonight?” 

*Guadalupe* - sometimes “Lupe” - was Araci’s sparring partner in the Portland Police self-defense class. Their relationship was professional, although there were signals something more might be possible. 

“Not tonight,” replied Araci. “Callista is leaving for another year in Mississippi and has promised to make dinner before she leaves. She’s trying to apologize for asking me to babysit her bird. Dinner tomorrow?”

Lupe smiled. “Dinner tomorrow, then.” She grabbed her bags and pushed through the crowd. 

Araci retrieved the scan in his visor and re-surveyed the room, comparing the two overlaid views; the real, burned room, and the original as shown in blueprints. An augmented reality outline filled in the missing parts of the destroyed counter. The oven had an overlay of before the explosion. All that remained was the back plane, stove, and fuel tank. The tank had burned, but was intact and at a crazy angle. Everything splayed outwards from the oven cavity; the explosion had clearly occurred there. 

The oven, a “Hestia” model, was easy to install and use. It had no controls, no dials. Instructions from the meal packet controlled it. A meal package comprised a multi-chambered cook plate with valves driven by a micro controller. The chambers contained ingredients. The controller opened valves at the proper time, communicating with the oven for temperature change. Just place a meal kit in the oven and stand back. Normally it produced a perfect dinner. Hestia had taken an angry turn for the worst.

Lupe’s scan allowed for an animated reconstruction of the explosion, tracing the path of all parts back to their original assembly. Araci played it forward and reverse three times. What happened was clear. The oven exploded. Dakota had been standing in front, possibly opening the door, when the thing unexpectedly distributed a high-velocity cloud of sharp plastic, metal, and glass shrapnel through her and into the room.

As for this condo, there was nothing more. He shipped the report to the Portland Police server and left the apartment clean-up to the forensics team.

// -----

“HUMAN ERROR,” screeched Rifkin. The African Gray parrot belonged to Callista Belo, Araci’s daughter. Araci agreed to care for the bird while she handled disaster relief in Mississippi. Rifkin’s previous owner had watched a lot of *2001 - A Space Odyssey* and Rifkin communicated with random quotes from the movie and always at full volume. 

Callista was making spaghetti in a packet. Just heat and serve. The salad and wine made it almost as good as his mother created in their antique kitchen.

“Did you ever consider one of those new ovens?” asked Araci. “They don’t need gas lines anymore. There’s a propane tank built-in.”

“Dad, that’s a luxury item I can’t afford,” she replied. “I’m too busy to fuss around. Besides, those manufacturer-sanctioned cook packets are expensive. It’s not like you can just whip up some batter and bake a cake. You can’t buy a bread kit from Red Mill and expect it to work with an oven that isn’t Red-Mill-certified. It’s so much easier with pouches. Cheaper too.”

“Probably safer,” said Araci. He forked up spaghetti, fending off Rifkin from his plate. It was easier to give Rifkin run of the apartment. The alternative was to lock him into his cage and endure deafening complaints. “I just saw the result of an explosion. Killed the occupant.”

“That’s not supposed to happen,” she said. “Everything I read says they are safe as tissue paper. Was it arson?”

“That’s possible,” he said. “But you can’t rule out human propensity to mess things up. Who’s to say the victim didn’t warm up some petroleum based beauty product at the same time as making dinner. Dumber things happen.”

“What about the victim? Was it an accident?”

“She had a fancy apartment with a luxury oven. She was a programmer, recently moved here from Montevideo. Used to work for a ransomware company. Looks to be social from her online profile, but not sure how long-term any of those relationships are.”

“I thought ransomware was outlawed?”

“Not necessarily,” Araci said. He pushed his plate to Rifkin, who grabbed a noodle and flew into the other room. Spaghetti sauce dripped behind, nothing was clean with Rifkin. “Ransomware is a messy business, but when it goes public, it has shareholder value. Mutual funds have political sway, and profits talk. Big Pharm made money on opioids. Same with ransomware. Worry not about the careless corporate victim, insurance covers the cost. It’s all very respectable and can be a resume builder.”

“So she moves, then dies in a freak accident. That’s not suspicious?”

“Point taken,” says Araci. “Could be she was escaping from something. Could be someone was unhappy about her departure. Could be her previous employer disapproved of her next move. Possibly a jealous boyfriend. Possibly an international cartel. All I have is a burned out condominium and a smoking corpse.”

// -----

Araci swept up bird trash. Again. Rifkin had been his roommate for less than a day, and it was a constant. Araci did it when he was thinking, a mindless activity for his body.

The more he found out about Robin Lopez, the more interesting he became. Robin was the author of “The Road To Food Free From Restrictions,” written with guidance from the Free Software Foundation. The book outlined how industry could and should take part in keeping food a basic human right. This included the manufacturer of Dakota’s hazardous oven, although appliance manufacturers were adamant they needed profits for research and development of new life-enriching products.

Robin worked with Abundancy, the same non-profit Dakota listed as her current project. Love and philanthropy often traveled together.

However, Abundancy had performed some violent activism. They hadn’t gone as far as claiming responsibility for breaking windows at Hestia factories, slashing tires of delivery vehicles, or the small-time arson at showrooms. They had disrupted shareholder meetings and sent letters just shy of threatening bodily harm. There was a dark side to Abundancy, and it seemed possible Robin was not the intelligent pacifist Dakota had followed to Portland.

“I AM PUTTING MYSELF TO THE FULLEST POSSIBLE USE!” screeched Rifkin. Rifkin had pried open the door of his cage and headed to the kitchen, destroying packages of bread left on the countertop. The floor vac robot was already in motion; Araci resignedly observed the bird and the vacuum to fight it out.

Leaving the kitchen ruckus, Araci retreated to the living room. If Robin was fighting with Hestia’s manufacturers, what was Dakota doing with the unit in her apartment? Robin’s toothbrush was testimony he knew about the stove. Was Dakota’s death the unexpected result of a lover’s argument? The flower of affection got lost in arguments about minutia and lovers had killed lovers because of the way they chewed food, cheated at cards, or felt about religion, politics, or family.

Dakota herself wasn’t an innocent. Working for a ransomware corporation might look corporate but in the end, it was about fraud. IT managers lost their jobs. CEOs stepped down. Stock prices fell. Operators enslaved and sold customer data. Dakota still accepted a paycheck. Did her past catch up in a sudden fashion?

Araci reviewed the file. Abundancy - which advocated food free of restrictions - connected Dakota and Robin.

“Rifkin, who would object to free food?” Araci spoke to the bird, but expected little a response. Presently Rifkin was destroying a piece of the carpet and couldn’t be bothered. No matter, Araci already suspected one villain; Hestia’s manufacturer. 

Araci’s call to Hestia’s manufacturer met with an artificially intelligent receptionist, projected through his visor as sitting across from him at the table. 

“Hello Araci Belo,” said the receptionist. “I’m here to help.” The AI exhibited artificial signs of life, but waited, saying nothing more.

“I’d like to speak to the Hestia Product Manager,” replied Araci. 

The receptionist didn’t hesitate. “I’m sorry, but our product managers are only available by appointment. Can I connect you with our media spokesperson?”

“No. I’m with the Portland Police Department and I’m working on a case involving one of your Hestia ovens.” Araci enunciated and spoke slowly, emphasizing the word ‘Police.’

“One minute please.” the receptionist paused, then faded to black. In their place appeared a dark-haired, middle-age man. He looked up and adjusted something on his desk.

“Hello Mr. Belo. My name is Farj Abdalla. I’m told you have some questions.” He waved his hand from off-screen to the center of his view, adding two more individuals. “This is Ms. Broin, our attorney, and Mr. Nilsson, who manages media relations for the Hestia Ovens. Since you are a police representative, we are recording this call. Do you object?”

The prickly reception did not surprise Araci. He’d used his police status to get the receptionist to act, but knew it would put everyone on guard. 

“I’m investigating the death of Dakota Williams...” 

Araci hadn’t finished speaking, but Broin the attorney immediately searched for something. She tapped Farj and pointed to whatever she had found. Dakota must already have a history with the company.

Farj muted and turned to Nilsson, then Broin, conferred for a minute, then returned to Araci.

“Dakota Williams is a member of Abundancy. We support the idea of unrestricted food for all and have issued several statements regarding our desire to work with Abundancy to accomplish this within the bounds of our corporation’s abilities.” 

Farj recited this without hesitation. This was not the first time he had to address issues with the Abundancy group. Araci wondered if the AI receptionist knew the line as well.

Araci tried again. “I understand your desire to work with Abundancy, but I’m more interested in an explosion of one of your devices.”

Araci made notes; Farj, Broin, and Nilsson knew Dakota Williams. They knew she was working with Abundancy. They didn’t act surprised to hear of her death. They either had a search on Dakota and had turned up a police report, or they had killed her themselves. The former was likely, the latter would be interesting. Araci pursued a hunch.

“I’m also investigating the whereabouts of Robin Lopez.”

Farj again muted and conferred, then answered Araci. “We can’t speculate on the relationship between Ms. Williams and Mr. Lopez. We know Ms. Williams owns a Hestia Oven, but that unit has not responded to our pings for several weeks. Ms. Williams has refused to allow us to provide maintenance, so we aren’t liable.”

“What have you heard about the malfunction?” asked Araci. “Have you determined the cause?”

“We had a team on site and I’m able to supply you with their report,” said Farj. “They noted you were there. I suspect you found the same; the oven wasn’t intact, and it was difficult to recover a significant amount of the pieces.”

“So right now, you don’t know what happened?”

“Correct,” answered Farj. “When we do, we’ll be happy to share those findings.”

Araci ended the call. Hestia would not provide any more information, so it made little sense to keep asking. He would need more details before speaking with them again.

// -----

Abundancy was Araci’s only connection to Lopez and Williams. He spent the better part of an hour trying to make contact; Layers of handlers shielded Abundancy. It wasn’t until he challenged one of the AIs with a non-specific police action that he made any progress. Legally, he couldn’t do anything, but he must have used the right combination of keywords to trigger the AI to summon a live person. A screen puppet appeared, their face obscured with a synthesized privacy mask.

“Detective Araci, we’re not stupid. Please don’t threaten us with legal action you can’t follow up on,” said whoever was behind the mask. “However, since you’re investigating what happened to Dakota, I want to make sure you’re aware of all the facts.”

“I recently spoke to the Hestia manufacturers,” said Araci. “They mentioned your organization.”

“I’m sure they did. They are using Dakota as an example of why food needs to be patented. They built their oven to work with their food trays - and *only* their food trays. They control the seed, they control the harvest, they control the preparation. It’s proprietary from field to consumer, locking out anyone who wants to do it themselves.”

“That’s interesting, but I’m only concerned about Dakota and Robin. Were they working on something related to Abundancy?”

“Dakota may have been reverse-engineering the oven and food API. But that’s Hestia intellectual property and I can’t condone illegal behavior. I can suggest you look at the financial impact if Hestia were to lose control of their food system. It might be worth killing someone. Not that corporations have ever done anything evil.”

“I appreciate your theories. When you’re ready to speak face to face, please contact me.” Araci ended the call. 

Would a corporation kill to protect intellectual property? Of course they would.

Araci’s visor announced a request from Lupe, which he gladly accepted. “Araci, we’re finding some interesting details in the scan of the condominium explosion. It takes some high resolution, come over to the media lab and see.”

// -----

The police media lab wasn’t much more than a room with desks and high-resolution monitors. The striking feature was the glass wall with a view of the servers. Privacy laws controlled this type of data under actual lock and key, so Araci had to visit in person.

“We had the render machines spend some quality time with the scans and found this interesting difference.” Lupe displayed the condominium scan Araci viewed earlier, this time in much higher resolution.

“There are two things you should see,” said Lupe. “Let’s start with the oven reconstruction.”

Lupe waved the room into view, then spread her hands to enlarge the space where the oven used to be. Spinning her fingers counter-clockwise re-assembled it to its assumed state before the explosion.

Lupe stopped the motion. “Okay, look right here. Do you see the circuits coming back together?” Lupe pointed at a green circuit board appearing in the oven. Parts were missing; the reconstruction could only do so much.

“This isn’t the standard Hestia circuit board. Someone installed a home-built version.”

“Can you move to the bedroom desk?” asked Araci.

The view stepped back from the oven, turned, and glided to the bedroom. When Araci had physically been in the room, he had seen circuit boards and electronics. They were visible in the render currently being shown, with the addition of tags identifying the parts.

“What is all of this?”

Lupe zoomed in and cross-referenced the tagged electronics. “Most of these are stock components. This one is an interface chip. This is a controller. But we can’t find specifications on this one. It could be anything. We’d need the logic diagram, probably located on a personal server and that requires a search warrant.”

Lupe magnified the view of the custom chip, froze it and split the screen. She moved back to the reconstruction of the oven and the circuit board. Some chips were only partially viewable; the known circuits were filled in from manufacturer specifications. One half of one chip was on the board, but not completed. Lupe grabbed the image of the chip from the desk and overlaid it on the oven circuit. It lined up perfectly. 

“Well. It appears Dakota was installing custom electronics.” Lupe saved the overlay. “We have the actual chip down in evidence. I’ll have it retrieved and sent to you.”

“That’s one mystery partially solved,” said Araci. “You mentioned you had two interesting things to show me?” 

“Yes, and I’ll resist making a stupid double entendre joke about showing you two things.” She laughed, then moved the view to the heating cavity of the oven, cutting through the external walls like X-Ray vision. Inside was a meal tray, but in worse shape than the circuit board. Bits of the tray were visible in the reconstruction. Large jagged gaps showed where missing pieces would go. 

“Look here,” said Lupe. “This serial number on the meal is only partially identified. But it doesn’t correspond to anything available on the open market. We don’t know where she could have gotten it.”

“A mystery meal in an altered oven,” said Araci. “Operator error compounded by hackery?” He silently pondered the rendered view of the condominium.

“So, dinner tonight?” asked Lupe.

“Absolutely. How about six,” responded Araci. “I have to warn you, I have a new room mate.”

“Six tonight works. Will your new roommate be gone by then?”

“No. He’ll still be there. But you’re going to love him.”

// -----

Rifkin loved breakfast. He loved everyone’s breakfast. Araci tried to explain to Rifkin that he wasn’t welcome, but Lupe refused to back him up and offered Rifkin bits of bacon from her plate.

“How about I leave you two to enjoy a meal together,” said Araci. “I’ll be in the next room.”

“Don’t leave,” replied Lupe. “It’s your apartment, after all. And your bird. I’m just a visitor.”

“And I’d like you to visit again. But now, we both have things to attend to.”

He saw Lupe off to work and cleaned up after Rifkin, then opened a call to Hestia. After a bit of wrangling with the AI receptionist, Farj Abdalla appeared.

“I have a few things I’d like to show you, but you’ll want to do this in person,” said Araci. “If you were to get a seat on the hyperloop, you could be here in time for an afternoon conference. Yes?”

“Normally no,” replied Farj. “But I have a light day and I’m intrigued. Are you buying lunch?”

“Sure. I’ll meet you at the counter in the PDX downtown station.”

// -----

Araci paid for lunch with Farj and Nilsson, the marketing guy for Hestia. Without time to linger, they caught the light rail to the police media station. Lupe already had the render of the oven displayed, and two boxes were arranged to the side.

“We’ve done some forensics, and need your ideas on what we’ve discovered,” explained Araci. “You’ve probably created a similar scan of your own, but this is what we are looking at.”

“Do you mind if I explore?” asked Farj. Lupe gave him control of the render. As Lupe had done yesterday, Farj moved past the outside shell of the oven and examined the circuit board.

“This is an amazing view. Must be quite the render farm behind this.” Farj looked beyond the window at the room full of computers. Araci noted several of the racks were frantically blinking; this virtual oven consumed megawatts of computations.

“I don’t suppose you have the actual parts of this board?” asked Farj.

“No, but we have something we think is related.” Araci opened the first box, displaying the electronics from Dakota’s desk. “Dakota was working on this, but we’re not sure what it is. We’re hoping you have some insight.”

Farj picked up the box and adjusted his visor. After a minute, Farj turned to Nilsson, pointing out the custom circuit and making a brief comment.

“It’s obvious Dakota was attempting to violate our intellectual property and patents,” Farj said to Lupe and Araci. “Much of this is stock components and duplicates of the parts shown on the circuit board in the oven. We do it differently, but the logic is likely the same.”

Farj pointed at the custom circuit. “This, I don’t know. If you could find the assembly plans you’d have a better idea of what this thing does.”

“How does Hestia feel about this custom circuit board?” asked Araci.

Nilsson replied. “We don’t like it. It violates the user agreement.”

Araci redirected the conversation. “Let’s look at this other box.”

Araci opened the smaller box; it contained what was left of the meal kit. He passed it to Farj. 

“This meal isn’t available on the market. I’m guessing it’s something you are working on privately and somehow Dakota got a sample.”

Nilsson seemed puzzled, but Farj was alarmed. He leaned in with his visor and examined every piece of the exploded meal parts, taking pictures of each. Putting down the box, he adjusted the view in his visor for several minutes. It was clear he was assembling a virtual reconstruction, but none of what he was doing was visible to Araci or Lupe.

Farj sat back. “I’ll explain later.” He told Nilsson.

“I really can’t talk about this,” Farj told Araci. 

“Is it something you built? Did Dakota build it?” Araci tried to get an answer from Farj.

“No. I can’t discuss this without a lawyer present.” Farj abruptly stood and motioned for Nilsson to do the same. “We need to go if we’re going to catch the loop home.”

Araci knew there were plenty of hyperloops back to San Francisco. Farj was making an excuse to leave. Something about the meal had him on edge. They barely had time to end the meeting before Farj and Nilsson were out the door and gone.

“What was that?” asked Lupe.

“A tell,” replied Araci. “A clue. Maybe my other friend has some ideas.”

Araci opened a call on his visor and shared it with Lupe. Abundancy’s AI was more resistant than Hestia, but after Araci made the same baseless threat, it again connected him to the anonymized puppet.

“Detective Belo, what is it now?” The puppet performed an adequate simulation of annoyance.

“We have a question about a meal kit, as well as electronics Dakota put in the oven.”

“I - Abundancy - wouldn’t know anything about that,” said the puppet.

“I’d also like to speak with Robin Lopez,” said Araci. “I believe that would be you.”

The puppet froze. “I don’t ... Robin isn’t ...,”

“I can get a privacy exemption if necessary,” said Araci. “If I have to do that, I’ll include Abundancy and Dakota. So, Robin, shall we talk face to face?”

The puppet looked away, then made a gesture to pull its face off. Araci recognized Robin from Dakota’s videos of Montevideo.

“I’m trying to stay alive,” said Robin. “The explosion was not an accident. I stepped out to get us something to eat and when I got back, there were alarms and smoke. I took a quick look, then ran. Dakota wasn’t moving and whoever caused the explosion might have still been around.”

“Okay. You were scared and ran. Let’s accept that for now. But Dakota had installed a custom circuit in the oven. Wouldn’t that level of tampering with the system be suspected to cause the explosion? Suppose you two brought this on yourselves.”

“NO. We did not.” Robin choked up. “Dakota was smart. And careful. She built in a fail-safe sensor. The meal she had in the oven was from a reputable manufacturer. It wasn’t like we were cooking meth.”

“There’s a lot to unpack here,” Araci said. “We know about a custom chip, but don’t know what it does. Do you have the schematic?”

“I can get it. It’s not that remarkable - it intercepts and logs commands from the meal. We were recording the process. With enough information, could build open source meals. Hestia is tricky about how they make the system work - we were going to open that up to the world. What we’re doing is legal, but they heard we were succeeding. That’s why they killed Dakota.”

“How do you suppose Hestia caused the explosion?”

“How should I know?” said Robin. “You’re the police. Isn’t this what you do?”

“Thanks for your confidence and help,” said Lupe.

“Next question,” started Araci. “You said the meal was from, and I quote: ‘a reputable manufacturer.’ Can we come to an agreement on where that meal came from? Would I be able to purchase that from a grocery vendor? “

Robin hesitated. “Not yet.” He looked away for a minute, sighed, and looked back. “That particular meal wasn’t commercially available. Friends of mine obtained it from WorldFood. We’re not the only group attempting to break Hestia’s food monopoly. Dakota said we could compare the behavior of the WorldFood meal against a standard Hestia meal for insight on how the system worked.”

“WorldFood makes meal kits for Hestia?” asked Araci.

“WorldFood makes generic meals for pouch heaters. Nothing with microcontrollers. Until now. But they know there’re profits to be made if they can supply an alternative to Hestia.”

“So you stole an experimental meal from a competitor, then stuffed it in a modified oven,” said Araci “Maybe this wasn’t a smart thing to do.”

“Wrong. Nobody would create an exploding meal. That would just be stupid. The WorldFood meal had already been tested - they were almost ready to release it. It was *found* on a shipping dock, going out for the last round of certification. WorldFood was moving on Hestia’s market with their brand of meals. We were moving on Hestia with open source meals.”

“So you’re saying Hestia reached out from the void and triggered an explosion?”

“Is that so hard to believe? They have access to everything. They can upgrade the oven software. They can shut it off. Why couldn’t they explosively defend their competitive advantage?”

“Just one more thing,” said Araci. “You said you were getting something to eat. But Dakota was cooking a meal.”

“Dakota was testing to see how the meal worked, not to eat it. Most of the time, the cooking process didn’t work, and the food was inedible. With earlier tests of Hestia proprietary products, we could see the meal communicate with the oven, but Dakota’s circuit didn’t respond - it just logged the request. The meal assumed everything was fine and proceeded through the process. Most of it came out like old soybeans and congealed fat. Nasty stuff.”

Araci looked at Lupe. There was a lot to untangle. Maybe they could compare notes after work.

// -----

“*irasshaimase!*”

The video screens scattered around the bar showed a cartoon sushi chef cheerfully welcoming them. Lupe and Araci sat at an unoccupied table and food immediately appeared. Four segments of a donut-shaped platform in the center of the table sequentially dropped out of sight, then raised up bearing drinks or food. If Lupe or Araci didn’t take an offering from one of the mini-elevators, it would periodically drop and return with something else, making a guess at what they would find tempting. The donut hole was for garbage. Drop something in - trash, drinks, plates, silverware, anything - and a quiet vacuum pulled it away.

Araci retrieved a beer, Lupe an old-fashioned, and the empty squares replenished with a bowl of peanuts and a salad. A robotic chef at the side of the room whirred, mixed drinks, and chopped food, trying to outguess Araci and Lupe with the most profitable menu.

“So. Whodunit?” asked Araci. “Was it the friendly folks at Hestia? Or did Dakota screw up?”

Lupe squeezed the orange in her drink, bit off the fruit, then dropped the peel in the garbage chute. Whoosh and gone. “For the sake of thinking out of the box, what if Robin did it? He was suspiciously absent.”

“He might have had the opportunity, but why would he do it? Seems like Dakota and Robin were on the same team, both for Abundancy and in a relationship.”

“I’ll agree. But I don’t think anything Dakota did was enough to light things up. Seems like her circuit was fail-safe. If something didn’t seem right, it would just log the request.”

Araci picked up the peanuts, then moved to put them back down. Too late; they were charged to his tab, and the platform dropped away, reappearing with a crudité platter. He surrendered and shelled a peanut. “That leaves us with Hestia. But I’m not convinced Farj is a killer.”

“He doesn’t have to be. What if a third party acted out of self-interest?” Lupe paused and stared at Araci. “Just a minute,” she said. She waved up a search window in her visor and concentrated. With a slight nod, she shared the results with Araci.

Araci saw Lupe’s search. It started with Dakota’s resume. It jumped to her previous ransomware employer. A hop over to corporate relationships produced an organization tree. On the tree, the ransomware company was highlighted, as was the line leading up the tree to the parent, then down a branch - which led to Hestia.

“Dakota was reverse-engineering intellectual property belonging to a sibling of her previous employer,” Lupe pointed out. “Whether she knew it, she violated some non-compete agreement, and was messing around with an ethically flexible sister company. Farj might not have pulled the trigger, but he knew people that would.”

“For that, I’m buying tonight’s drinks,” said Araci. “It fits. All that’s left to do is mountains of paperwork, but I think you’re on-target.”

He put three peanuts in his pocket for Rifkin.

// -----

Rifkin had lived with Araci for almost a week and was near to finished training him. Training Araci, that is. The bird had convinced him to leave the cage open (Parrots, when unhappy, can be louder than a shotgun blast) and taught him snacks were part of the daily routine. Carrots were acceptable, but only half of each carrot went inside of Rifkin. The other half went on the floor, table, chair, desk, floor, behind the chair, countertop, and again, the floor.

Araci was helping the robot vacuum clean smashed carrot when his visor announced a call. It was from someone using a privacy puppet.

“Hello Robin,” answered Araci. “Is there something new you’d like to discuss?”

“This isn’t Robin,” said the puppet. “I want to help you review your assumptions about Dakota Williams and Robin Lopez.”

Whoever was driving this animation had access to luxurious bandwidth. Robin’s puppet had been featureless. In comparison, this was a middle-age woman with astonishing detail in her face and hair. She dressed conservatively, but in current fashion. Sometimes puppets only rendered from the waist up; this was a full-body complete with sensible shoes.

“I don’t suppose you’d like to share your contact information?” asked Araci, knowing the anonymous caller would not do so.

She laughed, then leaned against the table. *How do they know there is a table?* thought Araci. 

“I’m an associate of Hestia. You’ve sent them a summons, and I’ve got some alternatives for you to consider.”

“I’m not willing to discuss this with an anonymous caller. There are legal channels Hestia should be following.”

“Hestia lawyers are preparing a response. Before that happens, I’m going to help you get back on the right track.”

“Well, I’ve got a lot of important things to do today.” Araci considered the pile of carrot droppings. “But I’m always interested in a mystery. Is this going to cost me?”

The woman chuckled. “No cost,” she said. “You need to consider the meal Dakota was playing with. Unfortunately, there isn’t enough of it left for you to examine. If you don’t already know, it was from WorldFood and you can’t buy them. In fact, you can’t even steal them anymore. Even if you could obtain one, you would have to hire some high-powered electrical engineers and some equally high-powered food engineers, then do months of research to figure out what’s unusual about it.”

The woman produced a meal kit from... somewhere. It was a virtual sleight-of-hand, if such a thing could exist.

“Fortunately, we’ve done this. And we’d like someone to slow down WorldFood’s progress. Since they are responsible for Dakota’s death, you would be the likely government entity to do the slowing. And best of all, you have good reason to do so. It’s not just for us.”

Araci sent the robot off to the kitchen. Rifkin followed it, possibly hoping it had access to the snack drawer. It didn’t, but the two noisy entities were now behind a door Araci could close. 

“You’re making a lot of claims, and you tell me I don’t have the wattage to check your work. I’ll state the obvious; why should I trust you?”

“Because we’ve sent you one of the kits. When you get it, you’ll be able to prove what I’m about to show you.” She held the meal in front of Araci. It doubled in size, then became transparent. It was a starburst pattern of food cavities, channels, pumps, valves, and electronics. A chip throbbed with a blue outline.

“This chip, the one outlined in blue light, is a new concept for meals. It’s full-blown artificial intelligence. It doesn’t make the meal sing or dance. It just solves problems - like any other AI. But it does two special things: first, it confirms the food preparation process is going according to plan. If not, it adjusts the recipe to recover. Second, it sends that learning back to the WorldFood server.”

Araci sat down. The woman puppet took a step closer and also sat, a chair materializing under her. A perfectly smooth animation and Araci forgot he was talking to thin air. 

“I assume Hestia meals also communicate back to the network.”

“True. But Hestia only collects the bare minimum. Privacy laws restrict what can be recorded. WorldFood made a questionable dodge around the restriction. They don’t record the actions from the user; they record the actions of the AI. The AI is responding to the oven and the user. See the difference?”

“I understand. It sounds like something a judge would be interested in discussing.”

“Try Congress and legislation,” she said. “This is a game changer and not just for food.”

“Sounds like a job for your lobbyist. I’m only interested in what - or who - blew up Dakota.”

The puppet put the meal back to wherever it had appeared from. “It’s the AI. We can’t directly test it, because we don’t have Dakota’s custom chip. You have it. Robin might make another. But we’re certain when Dakota put this meal in the oven, the AI tried to control things. The oven didn’t respond predictably, so the AI improvised. Somehow the AI decided it needed to open the gas valve. But the gas valve was already open. Dakota’s custom oven chip was lying to the AI. The oven and room were full of gas, but the AI didn’t know, so it lit the oven. WorldFood’s testing was not as careful as it should be. They’re going to damage Hestia’s reputation. That’s bad for profits.”

“And we’ll be able to test this when the meal shows up?”

She stood up. “Yes, you’ll be able to confirm what I’ve told you. And when you do, we would appreciate it if you pulled the summons from Hestia and sent it to WorldFood instead.”

Araci pondered. “I don’t make deals without evidence. How do I contact you when - or if - we confirm?”

“We’ll know. We’re watching the AI and can see what it communicates. Oh, and one more thing.”

Araci scratched his chin. Always one more thing. “What is it?”

“The scenario I just told you about is one of several. It’s the scenario with the highest probability. But there is another with a high likelihood. It could be the AI protected its intellectual property. The AI may have recognized Dakota’s attempt to reverse engineer the meal and took a defensive action.”

“You’re saying the meal blew up the oven to prevent Dakota from learning how it worked?”

“Self-destruct options are a standard part of military devices. Why not consumer goods? Like I said, this isn’t the strongest probability - but it’s very possible. Self-immolation would be a quick and easy way to prevent someone from finding how a meal is built. In any case - you might want to take precautions.”

She winked out of existence, leaving Araci alone in the room. From the kitchen, he heard Rifkin harassing the robot. He wondered how long it would be before it learned how to defend itself.
