Two decades after the earthquake, downtown Portland is almost cleared of debris. New buildings rise to optimistic heights and the Willamette river flows to the Columbia. Detective Araci Belo considered the view for a full half-minute, then shifted his focus back to the shattered glass. The room he stands in is on the 33rd floor of a luxury condominium built by the city. The hope is to attract new business and dispel the perception of Portland as a disaster zone. 

An explosion had propelled bits of the oven from the back of the condominium. Nothing had broken through the window. They were earthquake-proof, designed not to shred the pedestrians below with lethal glass daggers. Despite the cracks and bulls-eyes, they were the most intact feature of this room.

Besides Araci, there were two fire inspectors, a police imaging technician  ("Lupe"), two appliance maintenance people, a condo maintenance administrator, and her assistant. Three home owners’ association board members and neighbors on all sides of this condo stood in the hallway.

The sweet, meaty smell of burnt flesh emanated from Dakota Williams, the recently deceased occupant of the condominium. She lay on her back in the middle of the room; her severed right arm near the earthquake pillar. Her left forearm lay near the door. The explosion had burned through her clothing and bits of face, hair, and scalp stuck to the window. 

Araci stepped around Dakota and through the door to his left. This opened to the bedroom and a small bathroom. The bathroom was tidy, but not spotless. There were two toothbrushes in a cup. Before Araci could access the medical records kept by the bathroom mirror, he'd need a privacy waiver. He filed the request, but it would be days before department lawyers could get it cleared.

Araci pulled up Dakota's publicly shared space, which included pictures of her in Montevideo, always smiling, often in the middle of a plaza. In a video dated January 2059, a boy named Robin Lopez appeared. Araci traced Robin back to Portland, Oregon. He had visited Montevideo for an open source software convention. That spring, there were videos of Dakota boarding a plane to Portland for a long weekend. A month later Robin returned to Montevideo and appeared in several videos at Playa de Los Pocitos in daylight - dancing at night. The videos became more playful and intimate, leading up to Dakota's move to Portland. 

Araci could request a DNA test, but Robin Lopez owned the second toothbrush. His absence in this room was a gaping hole in the narrative. He wasn't a man of mystery; he had his own complete internet story. But he picked an interesting moment to go missing. Araci made a note to find him.

To be complete, he attached a summary of Dakota's history to the case file. She had recently moved from Montevideo, Uruguay, leaving behind an electrical engineer position with a publicly held ransomware company. Her resume listed a current affiliation with "Abundancy," a non-profit involved in food distribution.

Electronic parts cluttered the small desk; the things an Electronics Engineer might use.

"The scan is ready," said Officer Guadalupe Reyes. She pushed a few buttons on the back of a camera. "I've put the render in the report folder. You interested in grabbing some dinner tonight?" 

*Guadalupe* - sometimes "Lupe" - was Araci's sparring partner in the Portland Police Self-Defense class. Their relationship was professional, although there were signals something more might be possible. 

"Not tonight," replied Araci. "Callista is leaving for another year in Mississippi and has promised to make dinner before she leaves. She's trying to make up for asking me to babysit her bird. Dinner tomorrow?"

Lupe smiled. "Dinner tomorrow, then." She grabbed her bags and pushed through the crowd. 

Araci retrieved the scan in his visor and re-surveyed the room, comparing the two overlaid views; the real, burned room, and the room as shown in blueprints. An augmented reality outline filled in the missing parts of the destroyed counter. The oven, what little remained, had an overlay of the real oven before the explosion. All that remained was the back plane, stove, and fuel tank. The tank had burned, but was intact and at a crazy angle. Everything splayed outwards from the oven cavity; the explosion had clearly occurred there. 

The oven, a "Hestia" model, was easy to install and use. It had no controls, no dials. Instructions from the meal packet controlled it. A meal package comprised a multi-chambered cook plate with valves driven by a micro controller; part of the meal packet. The chambers contained ingredients. The controller opened valves at the proper time, communicating with the oven for temperature change. Just place a meal kit in the oven and stand back. Normally it produced a perfect dinner, but this time, Hestia had taken an angry turn for the worst.

Lupe's scan allowed for an animated reconstruction of the explosion, tracing the path of all parts back to their original assembly. Araci played it forward and reverse three times; most of the oven appeared in place. What happened was clear. The oven exploded. Dakota had been standing in front, possibly opening the door, when the thing unexpectedly distributed a high-velocity cloud of sharp plastic, metal, and glass shrapnel through her and into the room.

As for this condo, there was nothing more. He shipped the report to the Portland Police server and left the apartment clean-up to the forensics team.

// -----

"HUMAN ERROR," screeched Rifkin. The African Gray parrot belonged to Callista Belo, Araci's daughter. Araci agreed to care for the bird while his daughter handled disaster relief in Mississippi. Rifkin's previous owner had watched a lot of *2001 - A Space Odyssey* and Rifkin communicated with random quotes from the movie and always at full volume. 

Callista was making dinner. Spaghetti in a packet, boil and serve. The spaghetti was in a separate package from the sauce - which made it special. The salad and wine made it almost as good as his mother created in their antique kitchen.

"Did you ever consider one of those new ovens?" asked Araci. "They don't need gas lines anymore. There's a propane tank built-in."

"Dad, that's a luxury item I can't afford," she replied. "I'm too busy to fuss around with one of those things. Besides, those manufacturer-sanctioned cook packets are expensive. It's not like you can just whip up some batter and bake a cake. Buy the specific tray for whatever it is you want to cook - and it has to be compatible with your oven. You can't buy a bread kit from Red Mill and expect it to work with an oven that isn't red-mill-certified. It's so much easier with boil and serve pouches. Cheaper too."

"Probably safer," said Araci. He forked up spaghetti, fending off Rifkin from his plate. It was easier to give Rifkin run of the apartment. The alternative was to lock him into his cage and endure deafening complaints. "I just saw the result from one of those things exploding. Killed the occupant."

"That's not supposed to happen," she said. "Everything I read says they are safe as tissue paper. Was it arson?"

"Arson is always possible," he said. "But you can't rule out human propensity to mess things up. Who's to say the victim didn't warm up some petroleum based beauty product at the same time as making dinner. Dumber things happen."

"Do you know anything about the victim? Was it an accident?"

"I don't know her net worth, but she had a fancy apartment with a luxury oven. She was a programmer, recently moved here from Montevideo. Used to work for a publically held ransomware company. Looks to be social from her online profile, but not sure how long-term any of those relationships are."

"I thought ransomware was outlawed?"

"Not necessarily," Araci said. He pushed his plate to Rifkin, who grabbed a noodle and flew into the other room. Spaghetti sauce dripped behind, nothing was clean with Rifkin. "Ransomware is a messy business, but when it goes public, it has shareholder value. Mutual funds have political sway, and profits talk. Big Pharm made big money on opioids and made money for shareholders. Same with ransomware. Worry not about the careless corporate victim, insurance covers the cost. She was from Uruguay where it is all very respectable and can be a resume builder."

"So she moves, then dies in a freak accident. That's not suspicious?"

"Point taken," says Araci. "Could be she was escaping from something. Could be someone was unhappy about her departure. Could be her previous employer disapproved of her next move. Possibly a jealous boyfriend. Possibly an international cartel. All I have is a burned out condominium and a smoking corpse."

"You didn't mention what she was doing when the oven exploded. Was there a cook package? Probably in bits - but there must have been some parts left lying around."

Araci had already reviewed the scans. Replaying the reconstruction on the way to dinner, Araci had identified the victim's last intended meal. It was a non-standard specialty version of Chicken Marsala. Not available in grocery vendors, at least not this version. This meal was entirely outside of the public distribution chain. Dakota's move from a dicey ransomware company coupled with her quick demise from a non-standard tray of Chicken Marsala was one coincidence too many.

// -----

Araci swept up bird trash. Again. Rifkin had been his roommate for less than a day, and it was a constant. Araci did it when he was thinking, a mindless activity for his body so he could think about other things.

The more he found out about Robin Lopez, the more interesting he became. Robin was the author of "The Road To Food Free From Restrictions," written with guidance from the Free Software Foundation. The book outlined how industry could and should take part in keeping food a basic human right. This included the manufacturer of Dakota's hazardous oven, although appliance manufacturers were adamant they needed profits for research and development of new life-saving products.

Robin worked with Abundancy, the same non-profit Dakota listed as her current project. Love and philanthropy often traveled together.

However, Abundancy had created some violent activism. They hadn't gone as far as claiming responsibility for breaking windows at Hestia factories, slashing tires of delivery vehicles, or the small-time arson at showrooms. They had disrupted shareholder meetings and sent letters just shy of threatening bodily harm. There was a dark side to Abundancy, and it seemed possible Robin was not the intelligent pacifist Dakota had followed to Portland.

"I AM PUTTING MYSELF TO THE FULLEST POSSIBLE USE!" screeched Rifkin. Rifkin had pried open the door of his cage and was heading to the kitchen. Araci followed a minute later to observe the bird ripping apart a box of crackers. The floor vac robot was already in motion and Araci resignedly observed the bird and the vacuum fight it out.

Leaving the kitchen ruckus of vacuum vs bird, Araci retreated to the living room. If Robin was fighting with Hestia's manufacturers, what was Dakota doing with the unit in her apartment? Robin's toothbrush was testimony he knew about the stove. Was Dakota's death the unexpected result of a lover's argument? The flower of affection got lost in arguments about minutia and lovers had killed lovers because of the way they chewed food, cheated at cards, or felt about religion, politics, or family.

Dakota herself wasn't an innocent. Working for a ransomware corporation might look corporate but in the end, it was about fraud. IT managers lost their jobs because of ransomware. CEOs stepped down. Stock prices fell. Less scrupulous operators enslaved and sold customer data. Dakota knew this and still accepted a paycheck. Did her past catch up in a sudden fashion?

Araci reviewed the file. Abundancy - which advocated food free of restrictions connected Dakota and Robin.

"Rifkin, who would object to free food?" Araci spoke to the bird, but expected little a response. In fact, Rifkin was destroying a piece of the carpet and couldn't be bothered. No matter, Araci already knew one villain; Hestia's manufacturer. 

Araci's call to Hestia's manufacturer met with an artificially intelligent receptionist, projected through his visor as sitting across from him at the table. 

"Hello Araci Belo," said the receptionist. "I'm here to help." The receptionist exhibited artificial signs of life, but waited, saying nothing more.

"I'd like to speak to the Hestia Product Manager," replied Araci. 

The receptionist didn't hesitate. "I'm sorry, but our product managers are only available by appointment. Can I connect you with our media department?"

"No. I'm with the Portland Police Department and I'm working on a case involving one of your Hestia ovens. I'd like to speak with the product manager." Araci enunciated and spoke slowly, emphasizing the word 'Police.'

"One minute please." the receptionist paused, then faded to black. In their place appeared a dark-haired, middle-age man. He looked up and adjusted something on his desk.

"Hello Mr. Belo. My name is Farj Abdalla. I'm told you have some questions." Farj waved his hand from off-screen to the center of his view, adding two more individuals to the call. "This is Ms. Broin, our attorney, and Mr. Nilsson, who manages media relations for the Hestia Ovens. Since you are a police representative, we are recording this call. Do you object?"

The prickly reception did not surprise Araci. He'd used his police status to get the receptionist to act, but knew it would put everyone on guard. 

"I'm investigating the death of Dakota Williams..." 

Araci hadn't finished speaking, but Broin the attorney immediately searched for something. She tapped Farj and pointed to whatever she had found. It was invisible to Araci. Dakota must already have a history with the company.

Farj muted and turned to Nilsson, then Broin, conferred for a minute, then returned to Araci.

"Dakota Williams is a member of Abundancy. We support the idea of unrestricted food for all and have issued several statements regarding our desire to work with Abundancy to accomplish this within the bounds of our corporation's abilities." 

Farj spoke this line with no hesitation. He had practiced it before; this was not the first time he had to address issues with the Abundancy group. Araci wondered if the AI receptionist knew the line as well.

Araci tried again. "I understand you might have issues with Abundancy, but I'm more interested in trying to sort out some issues related to an explosion of one of your devices."

Despite expressing disinterest, Araci made notes; Farj, Broin, and Nilsson knew Dakota Williams. They knew she was working with Abundancy. They didn't act surprised to hear of her death. They either had a search on Dakota and had turned up a police report, or they had killed her themselves. The former was likely, the latter would be interesting. Araci pursued a hunch.

"I'm also investigating the whereabouts of Robin Lopez. They seem to be related."

Farj again muted and conferred, then answered Araci. "We can't speculate on the relationship between Ms. Williams and Mr. Lopez. We know Ms. Williams owns a Hestia Oven, but that unit has not responded to our pings for several weeks. Ms. Williams has refused to allow us to provide maintenance, so we aren't liable for any resulting malfunction."

"What have you heard about the malfunction?" asked Araci. "Have you determined the cause?"

"We had a maintenance team on site and I'm able to supply you with their report," said Farj. "They noted you were there. I suspect you found the same as our team; the oven wasn't intact, and it was difficult to recover a significant amount of the pieces. Obviously we're interested in what happened, but aren't ready to share any conclusions."

"So right now, you don't know what happened?"

"Correct," answered Farj. "We don't know what happened. When we do know, we will be happy to share those findings."

Araci made sure they had his contact information, then ended the call. Hestia would not provide any more information so it made little sense to keep asking. He would need more details before speaking with them again.

// -----

Abundancy was Araci's only connection to Lopez and Williams. Hestia was also aware of the organization. They seemed to be central to something. Araci spent the better part of an hour trying to make contact; Layers of call handlers shielded Abundancy. Several times he explained he was on police business and was investigating Dakota Williams and Robin Lopez.

It wasn't until he challenged one of the AIs with a non-specific police action that he made any progress. Legally, he couldn't do anything, but he must have used the right combination of keywords to trigger the AI to summon a live person. A screen puppet appeared, their face obscured with a synthesized privacy mask. A live person was behind the puppet, but their identity was a secret.

"Detective Araci, we're not stupid. Please don't threaten us with legal action you can't follow up on," said whoever was behind the mask. "However, since you're investigating what happened to Dakota, I want to make sure you're aware of all the facts."

"I recently spoke to the Hestia manufacturers," said Araci. "They mentioned your organization."

"I'm sure they did. They are using Dakota as an example of why food needs to be patented. They built their oven to work with their food trays - and *only* their food trays. First, they control the seed, then they control the harvest, then they control the preparation. It's proprietary food from field to consumer, locking out anyone who wants to do it themselves."

"That's interesting, but I'm only concerned about Dakota and Robin. Were they working on something related to Abundancy?"

"Dakota may have been reverse-engineering the oven and food API. But that's Hestia intellectual property and I can't condone illegal behavior. But I can suggest you look at the financial impact if Hestia were to lose control of their food system. It might be worth killing someone. Not that corporations have ever done anything evil or illegal."

"I appreciate your theories. When you're ready to speak face to face, please contact me." Araci ended the call. 

Would a corporation kill to protect intellectual property? Of course they would.

Araci's visor announced a request from Lupe, which he gladly accepted. "Araci, we're finding some interesting details in the scan of the condominium explosion. It takes some pretty high resolution, come over to the media lab and see."

// -----

The police media lab wasn't much more than a room with desks and high-resolution monitors. The striking feature was the glass wall with a view of the servers. Privacy laws controlled this type of data under actual lock and key. Humans and their nasty organic residue weren't allowed in with the computers. So Araci had to come visit in person.

"We had the render machines spend some quality time with the scans of the room and found this interesting difference from the original view." Lupe controlled the displays. One showed a programming interface, another showed the rendered output. Lupe displayed a view of the condominium scan Araci had been viewing earlier, but in much higher resolution.

"There are two things you should see," said Lupe. She could have manipulated the view through the code interface, but used hand gestures instead. "Let's start with the oven reconstruction."

Lupe waved the room into view, then spread her hands to enlarge the space where the oven used to be. Spinning her fingers in a counter-clockwise motion brought a flood of oven parts back into view, re-assembling the oven to its assumed state before the explosion.

Lupe stopped the motion. "Okay, look right here. Do you see the circuits coming back together?"

Lupe pointed at a green circuit board appearing in the back of the oven. Parts were missing; the reconstruction could only do so much and chose not to fill in missing data.

"This isn't the standard Hestia circuit board. Someone installed a home-built version."

"Can you move to the scan of the bedroom desk," asked Araci.

The view stepped back from the oven, turned, and glided to the bedroom. "Move to the equipment on the desk, please."

When Araci had physically been in the room, he had seen these circuit boards and electronics. They were visible in the render currently being shown, with the addition of tags identifying the parts.

"What is all of this?"

Lupe zoomed in and cross-referenced the tagged electronics. "Most of these are stock components. This one is an interface chip. This is a controller. But this one - we can't find any specifications. It could be anything. We'd need the logic diagram, probably located on a personal server and we'd need a search warrant."

Lupe magnified the view of the custom chip, froze the view and split the screen. She moved back to the reconstruction of the oven and the circuit board. Some chips were only partially viewable; the known circuits were filled in from manufacturer specifications. One half of one chip was on the board, but not completed. Lupe grabbed the chip from the view of the desk and overlaid it on the oven circuit. It lined up perfectly. 

"Well. It appears Dakota was installing custom electronics in the oven." Lupe saved the overlay. "We have that chip down in evidence. I'll have it retrieved and sent to you."

"That's one mystery partially solved," said Araci. "You said you had two interesting things to show me?" 

"Yes, and I'll resist making a stupid double entendre joke about showing you two things." She laughed, then moved the view to the heating cavity of the oven, cutting through the external walls like X-Ray vision. Inside was a meal tray, but in worse shape than the circuit board. Bits of the tray were visible in the reconstruction. Large jagged gaps showed where missing pieces would go. 

"Look here," said Lupe. "This serial number on the meal is only partially identified. But it doesn't correspond to anything available on the open market. We do not know where she could have gotten it. Dakota was preparing some sort of mystery meal when the whole thing went boom."

"A mystery meal in an altered oven," said Araci. “Operator error compounded by hackery?” He silently pondered the rendered view of the condominium.

"So, dinner tonight?" asked Lupe.

"Absolutely. How about six tonight," responded Araci. "I have to warn you, I have a new room mate."

"Six tonight works. Is your new roommate going to be gone by then?"

"No. He'll still be there. But I think you're going to love him."

// -----

Rifkin loved breakfast. He loved everyone's breakfast. Araci tried to explain to Rifkin that he wasn't welcome, but Lupe refused to back him up and offered Rifkin bits of bacon from her plate.

"How about I leave you two to enjoy a meal together," said Araci. "I'll be in the next room."

"Don't leave," replied Lupe. "It is your apartment, after all. And your bird. I'm just a visitor."

"And I'd like you to visit again. But we both have things to attend to."

After seeing Lupe off to work and cleaning up after Rifkin, Araci opened a call to Hestia. After a bit of wrangling with the AI receptionist, Farj Abdalla appeared.

"I have a few things I'd like to show you, but you'll want to do this in person," said Araci. "If you were to get a seat on the hyperloop, you could be here in time for lunch and an afternoon conference. Yes?"

"Normally no," replied Farj. "But I have a light day and I'm intrigued. Are you buying lunch?"

"Sure. I'll meet you at the lunch counter in the PDX downtown station."

// -----

Araci paid for lunch with Farj and Nilsson, the marketing guy for Hestia. Without time to linger, they caught the light rail to the police media station. Lupe already had the render of the oven displayed, and two boxes were arranged to the side.

"We've done some forensics, and need your ideas on what we've discovered," explained Araci. "You've probably created a similar scan of your own, but this is what we are looking at."

"Do you mind if I explore?" asked Farj. Lupe gave him control of the render and Farj expanded the view of the oven. As Lupe had done yesterday, Farj moved the view past the outside shell of the oven and examined the circuit board.

"This is an amazing view. Must be quite the render farm behind this." Farj looked beyond the window at the room behind. Araci noted several of the racks were frantically blinking; megawatts of computations were being consumed to provide this virtual oven.

"I don't suppose you have the actual parts of this board?" asked Farj.

"No, but we have something we think is related." Araci opened the first box, displaying the electronics from Dakota's desk. "Dakota was working on this, but we're not sure what it is. We're hoping you can provide some insight."

Farj picked up the box and adjusted his visor. Araci assumed Farj was running a diagnostic on the components, identifying parts and functions. After a minute, Farj turned to Nilsson, pointing out the custom circuit and making a brief comment. He returned the box to the table.

"It's obvious Dakota was attempting to violate our intellectual property and patents," Farj said to Lupe and Araci. "Much of this is stock components and duplicates of the parts shown on the circuit board in the oven. We do it differently, but the logic is likely the same."

Farj pointed at the custom circuit. "This, I don't know. There are companies specializing in reverse-engineering logic. It's expensive. If you could find the assembly plans you'd have a better idea of what this thing does."

"How does Hestia feel about this custom circuit board?" asked Araci.

Nilsson replied. "We don't like it. It violates the user agreement and we will defend ourselves. In court."

"You're aware Dakota died in an unusual fashion?" asked Araci. 

"We are aware of that," replied Nilsson. "Are you making an accusation?"

"Maybe not yet," replied Araci. He redirected the conversation. "Let's look at this other box."

Araci opened the smaller box containing what was left of the meal kit. He passed it to Farj, then adjusted the view of the oven to display the reconstructed meal in the oven cavity. 

"This meal isn't available on the market. I'm guessing it's something you are working on privately and somehow Dakota got a sample."

Nilsson seemed puzzled, but Farj was alarmed. He leaned in with his visor and examined every piece of the exploded meal parts, taking pictures of each. Putting down the box, he adjusted the view in his visor for several minutes. It was clear he was assembling a virtual reconstruction in his visor, but none of what he was doing was visible to Araci or Lupe.

Farj sat back. "I'll explain later." He told Nilsson.

"I really can't talk about this," Farj told Araci. 

"Is it something you built? Did Dakota build it?" Araci tried to get an answer from Farj.

"No. I can't discuss this without a lawyer present. We need to go if we're going to catch the train home."

Araci knew there were plenty of hyperloops back to San Francisco. Farj was making an excuse to leave. Something about the meal had him on edge. They barely had time to end the meeting before Farj and Nilsson were out the door and gone.

"What was that?" asked Lupe.

"A tell," replied Araci. "A clue. Maybe my other friend has some ideas."

Araci opened a call on his visor and shared it with Lupe. Abundancy's AI was more resistant than Hestia, but after Araci made the same baseless threat, it again connected him to the anonymized puppet.

"Detective Belo, what is it now?" The puppet performed an adequate simulation of annoyance.

"We have a question about a meal kit, as well as electronics Dakota put in the oven."

"I - Abundancy - wouldn't know anything about that," said the puppet.

"I'd also like to speak with Robin Lopez," said Araci. "I believe that would be you."

The puppet froze. "I don't ... Robin isn't ... "

"I can get a privacy exemption if necessary," said Araci. "If I have to do that, I'll include Abundancy and Dakota for efficient use of my time. So, Robin, shall we talk face to face?"

The puppet looked away, then made a gesture to pull it's face down. Robin Lopez appeared, Araci recognized him from Dakota's videos of Montevideo.

"I'm trying to stay alive," said Robin. "The oven explosion was not an accident. I had stepped out to get us something to eat and when I got back, there were alarms and a lot of people. I took a quick look then ran. Dakota wasn't moving and whoever caused the explosion might still be around."

"Okay. You were scared and ran. Let's accept that for now. But Dakota had installed a custom circuit in the oven and was preparing a custom meal. Wouldn't that level of tampering with the system be suspect to cause the explosion. Suppose you two brought this on yourselves."

"NO. We did not." Robin choked up. "Dakota was smart. And careful. She built in gas limiters, even a fail-safe sensor. The meal she had in the oven was from a reputable manufacturer. It wasn't like we were cooking meth."

"There's a lot to unpack here. Let's start with the circuit," Araci said. "We know about a custom chip, but don't knw what it does. Do you have the schematic?"

"I can get it. It's not that remarkable - it intercepts and logs commands from the meal. We were cooking meals and recording the process. If we did enough, we could build open source meals. Hestia is tricky how they make the system work - we were going to open that up to the world. What we're doing is legal, but they heard we were succeeding. That's why they killed Dakota."

"How do you suppose Hestia caused the explosion?"

"How should I know?" said Robin. "You're the police. Isn't this what you do?"

"Thanks for your confidence and assistance," said Lupe.

"Next question," started Araci. "I said it was a custom meal. You said it was from, and I quote: 'a reputable manufacturer.' Can we come to an agreement on where that meal came from? Would I be able to purchase that from a reputable grocery vendor? "

Robin hesitated. "Not yet." He looked away for a minute, sighed, and looked back. "That particular meal wasn't commercially available just yet. Friends of mine acquired it from one of Hestia's competitors. We're not the only group attempting to break Hestia's food monopoly. Dakota said we could compare the behavior of the competitive meal against a standard Hestia meal for insight on how the system worked."

"So you stole an experimental meal from a competitor, then stuffed it in a modified oven," said Araci "I'm coming back around to maybe this wasn't a smart thing to do."

"Wrong. Nobody would create an exploding meal. That would just be stupid. The meal we were experimenting with had already been tested - they were almost ready to release it. It was *found* on a shipping dock, ready for the last round of certification and testing. There was nothing dangerous about that meal."

"So you're saying Hestia reached out from the void and triggered an explosion?"

"Is that so hard to believe? They have access to everything about that device. They can upgrade it. They can shut it off. Why couldn't they plant a virus to defend their competitive advantage?"

Araci looked at Lupe. There was a lot to untangle. Maybe they could compare notes at a bar after work.
