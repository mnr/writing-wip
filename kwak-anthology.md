Downtown Portland was almost cleared of debris. Two decades after the earthquake, new buildings were rising to optimistic heights and the river was again flowing. Detective Araci Belo considered the view for a full half-minute, then shifted his focus back to the shattered glass between him and downtown.

This building was one of the two luxury condominiums built by the city. The hope was to attract new business and to dispell the perception of Portland as a disaster zone. Which it actually was - or had been. The current state of this apartment was not helping the reconstruction narrative. The explosion had propelled improvised missles towards the window, but none had broken through. Despite the cracks and bulls-eyes, the windows were the most intact feature of the room. They were earthquake-proof, designed not to shred the pedestrians below with lethal glass daggers. 

The opening to his left showed the bedroom and bath. The bed was tidy and the floor clean, outside of a few kitchen items thrown there by the explosion. The wall running through the center of the condo had directed the blast in one direction - like a cannon - towards the external wall. Two body parts had bounced off the earthquake pillars, leaving blood at the impact points. The sprinklers hadn't removed all the evidence.

"The scan is ready," said Officer Guadalupe Reyes. She pushed a few buttons on the back of a camera. "I've put the render in the report folder. You interested in grabbing some dinner tonight?" 

*Guadalupe* - sometimes "Lupe" - was Araci's sparring partner in the Portland Police Self-Defense class. Their relationship was professional, although there were signals something more might be possible. 

"Not tonight," replied Araci. "My daughter is leaving for another year in Mississippi and has promised to make dinner before she leaves. She's trying to make up for asking me to babysit her bird. Dinner tomorrow?"

Lupe smiled. "Dinner tomorrow, then." She grabbed her bags and jostled her way through the crowd of two fire inspectors, three home owners association board members, two appliance maintenance people, a condo maintenance administrator, her assistant, and neighbors on all sides of this condo. 

Araci engaged the scan in his visor and re-surveyed the room. The semi-transparent image of the counter filled in the missing parts of the real counter. There was less of the real oven; all that remained was the back plane, stove, and fuel tank. The tank was burned, but intact, but at a crazy angle from where it was supposed to be. Everything splayed outwards from the oven cavity where the explosion had clearly occured. Behind the oven the wall had a shallow crater. 

Ovens were probably *not* supposed to explode, although ovens were rare, so their expected behavior was statistically unknown. Araci assumed it would be crazy for a manufacturer to build a luxury kitchen device with the expectation it would kill the owner. Which it had.

Araci stood at the feet of Dakota Williams, the deceased occupant of the condominium. She lay on her back in the middle of the room. Her right arm was near the earthquake pillar, severed at the shoulder. Her left forearm lay near the door. Bits of face, hair, and scalp were stuck to the broken window. The explosion had burned through her clothing and flesh, leaving fourth-degree burn marks.

What happened was clear. The oven exploded. Dakota had been standing in front of the oven, possibly opening the door when the thing unexpectedly distributed a high-velocity cloud of sharp plastic, metal, and glass shrapnel through her and into the room.

As to this condo, there was nothing more. He shipped the report to the Portland Police server and left the apartment clean-up to the forensics team.

"HUMAN ERROR," screeched Rifkin. The African Gray parrot belonged to Callista Belo, Araci's daughter. Araci agreed to babysit the bird while his daughter handled disaster relief in Mississippi. Rifkin's previous owner had watched a lot of *2001 - A Space Oddessy* and Rifkin communicated with random quotes from the movie. Always at full volume. 

Callista was making dinner. Nothing special. Spaghetti in a packet, boil and serve. The spaghetti was in a separate package from the sauce - which made it special. The salad and wine made it almost as good as his mother created in their antique kitchen.

"Did you ever consider one of the modern ovens?" asked Araci. "They don't need gas lines anymore. There's a propane tank built-in."

"Dad, that's a luxury item I can't afford," she replied. "I'm too busy to fuss around with one of those things. Besides, those special cook packets are expensive. It's not like you can just whip up some dough and bake a cake. You have to buy the specific tray for whatever it is you want to cook - and it has to be compatible with your oven. You can't buy a bread kit from Red Mill and expect it to work with an oven that isn't red-mill-certified. It's so much easier with boil and serve pouches. Cheaper too."

"Probably safer as well," said Araci. He forked up spaghetti, fending off Rifkin from his plate. It was easier to give Rifkin run of the apartment. The alternative was to lock him into his cage and endure deafening complaints. "I just saw the results from one of those things exploding. Killed the occupant."

"That's not supposed to happen," she said. "Everything I see says they are as safe as tissue paper. Was it arson?"

"Arson is always possible," he said. "But you can't rule out human ingenuity. Who's to say the victim didn't try to warm up some petroleum based beauty product at the same time as making dinner. Dumber things happen."

"Do you know anything about the victim. Was it an accident, or did someone have a grudge?"

"Her name was Dakota Williams. I don't know her net worth, but she had a fancy apartment with a luxury oven. She was a programmer, recently moved here from Montevideo. Worked remotely for a publically-held ransomware company. Looks to be social from her online profile, but not sure how long-term any of those relationships are."

"Isn't ransomware a career path in felonies?"

"Not necessarily," Araci said. He pushed his plate to Rifkin, who grabbed a noodle and flew into the other room. Spaghetti sauce dripped behine. Nothing was clean with Rifkin. "Ransomware is a messy business, but when it goes public, it has shareholder value. Mutual funds have political sway, and profits talk. Big Pharm made big money on opiods, and passed that money to shareholders. Same with ransomware. Worry not about the careless corporate IT group, insurance covers the cost. It's all very corporate and can be a resume builder."

"So moves, then dies in a freak accident. Nothing to see here?"

"Point taken," says Araci. "Could be she was escaping from something. Could be something was unhappy about her departure. Could be her next move was not approved by her previous employer. Possibly a jealous boyfriend. Possibly an international cartel. All I have is a burned out condominium and a smoking corpse."

"You didn't mention what she was doing when the oven exploded. Was there a cook package left in the room? Probably in bits - but there must have been some parts left laying around."

Araci had already reviewed the scans. Replaying the reconstruction on the way to dinner, Araci had identified the victim's last intended meal. The meal was a non-standard speciality version of Chicken Marsala. Not available in grocery stores, at least not this version. It wasn't even a beta release, sometimes available from manufacturers for testing. This meal was entirely outside of the public distribution chain. He didn't share this with Rifkin or his daughter, but it placed this outside the range of acceptable accidents. Dakota's move from a dicey ransomware company coupled with her quick demise from a non-standard tray of chicken marsala was one coincidence too many.
