Downtown Portland was almost cleared of debris, new buildings were rising to optimistic heights, and the river was flowing. Detective Araci Belo considered the view for a full half-minute, then shifted his focus back to the shattered glass between him and the view.

This building was one of the two luxury condominiums built by the city. The hope was to attract new business and to dispell the perception of Portland as a disaster zone. Which it actually was. The current state of this apartment was not helping the reconstruction narrative.

The windows were earthquake-proof, designed not to shred the pedestrians below with lethal glass daggers. The explosion had propelled improvised missles towards the window, but none had broken through. Despite the cracks and bulls-eyes, the windows were the most intact feature of the room.

The opening to his left showed the bedroom and bath. The bed was tidy and the floor clean, outside of a few kitchen items picked up by the explosion. The wall running through the center of the condo had directed the blast in one direction - like a cannon - towards the external wall. Two body parts had bounced off the earthquake pillars, leaving blood at the impact points.

Araci turned away from the window and signaled his visor to provide a reconstruction of the room. The semi-transparent image of the counter filled in the missing parts of the real counter. There was less of the oven; all that remained was the back plane, stove, and fuel tank. Each was splayed outwards from the oven cavity where the explosion had clearly occured. The tank was burned, but intact. Behind the oven the wall had a shallow crater. 

Ovens were probably *not* supposed to explode, although ovens were rare, so their expected behavior was statistically unknown. Araci assumed it would be crazy for a manufacturer to build a luxury kitchen device with the expectation it would kill the owner. Which it had.

Araci stood at the feet of Dakota Williams, the deceased occupant of the condominium. She lay on her back in the middle of the room. Her right arm was near the earthquake pillar, severed at the shoulder. Her left forearm lay near the door. Bits of face, hair, and scalp were stuck to the broken window. The explosion had burned through her clothing and flesh, leaving fourth-degree burn marks matching the wall behind the no-longer-existing oven.

What happened was clear. The oven exploded. No mystery here. Dakota had been standing in front of the oven, possibly opening the door when the thing unexpectedly distributed a high-velocity cloud of sharp plastic, metal, and glass shrapnel through Dakota and into the room.

His visor alerted him to the arrival of the scan of the condo, signed by Officer Guadalupe Reyes. *Guadalupe* - sometimes "Lupe" - was Araci's partner in the Portland Police Self-Defense class. Their relationship was professional, although there were signals of a potential for something more. 

As to this condo, there was nothing more. He generated the report, shipped it off to the Portland Police server and headed home. His daughter was making dinner one last time before she left for disaster relief in Mississippi.
