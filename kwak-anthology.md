Downtown Portland was almost cleared of debris, new buildings were rising to optimistic heights, and the river was again flowing. Detective Araci Belo considered the view for a full half-minute, then shifted his focus back to the shattered glass between him and the view.

This building was one of the two luxury condominiums built by the city. The hope was to attract new business and to dispell the perception of Portland as a disaster zone. Which it actually was.

The windows were earthquake-proof, designed not to shred the pedestrians below with lethal glass daggers. The explosion had propelled improvised missles to that end of the room, but none had broken through. Despite the cracks and bulls-eyes, the windows were the most intact feature of the room.

The opening to his left showed the bedroom and bath. The bed was tidy and the floor clean, outside of a few kitchen items. The wall running through the center of the condo had directed the blast in one direction - like a cannon - towards the external wall. At least two of them had bounced off the earthquake pillars, leaving blood marks at the impact points.

Araci turned away from the window and signaled his visor to provid a reconstruction of the back of the room. The semi-transparent image of the counter filled in the missing parts of the real counter. The virtual image of the oven stood alone; there was no oven remaining, only a dark burn and a shallow crater in the concrete wall. 

Ovens were probably *not* supposed to explode, although they were rare, so their expected behavior was statistically unknown. But it would be crazy for a manufacturer to build a luxury kitchen device with the expectation it would kill the owner. Which it had.

Araci stood at the feet of Dakota Williams, the owner. She lay on her back in the middle of the room. Her right arm was near the earthquake pillar, severed at the shoulder. Her left forearm lay near the door. Bits of face, hair, and scalp were stuck to the broken window. The explosion had burned through her clothing and flesh, leaving deep burn marks that matched the wall behind the no-longer-existing oven.

What had happened was clear. The oven exploded. No mystery here. Dakota had been standing in front, possibly getting ready to open the oven door when the thing unexpectedly distributed a high-velocity cloud of sharp plastic, metal, and glass shrapnel into Dakota and the room.
