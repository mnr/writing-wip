# Present the crime

Detective Araci Belo admires the view of post-earthquake Portland from this small condominium. The west hills provide a lush green background to the dense housing towers, interconnected by skyways and hypertube stations. 

He pulls his focus back to consider the shattered room. The explosion had propelled bits of the oven from the back of the condo, spraying shrapnel towards the window. The room is scorched, and the sweet, meaty smell of burnt flesh emanates from Dakota Williams, the recently deceased occupant of the condominium. She lays on her back in the middle of the room; her severed right arm near the earthquake pillar. Her left forearm leans against the wall. The explosion burned through her clothing, face, and skin.

Pieces of meal boxes are scattered around the room. How many is difficult to know; metal and plastic shards are mixed with uncooked food. One meal is in the far corner, complete except for a dented corner. The cube, small enough to hold in two hands, is covered with a bright depiction of the traditional (soy-based) steak and potatoes with brussels sprouts.  

Araci steps around Dakota and through the door to the other half of the condominium containing the bedroom and bath. The bathroom is tidy, but not spotless. There are two toothbrushes in a cup and enough towels for a couple. The bedroom has a dresser, bed, and desk cluttered with electronic parts. The bed is neat; the floor picked up except for a few kitchen utensils thrown in by the explosion.

“The scan is ready,” says Officer Guadalupe Reyes, one of the many people swarming the condominium. She pushes a  button on a hand-held terminal. “I’ve put the render in the report folder. You interested in grabbing some dinner tonight?” 

*Guadalupe* - sometimes “Lupe” - is Araci’s sparring partner in the Portland Police self-defense class. Their relationship is professional, although there are signals something more might be possible. 

“Sure. Six pm?” replies Araci. “Come to my place and I’ll make you a dinner that doesn’t explode.”

“You are such a buzzkill. I was hoping for excitement.” She grabs her bags and pushes through the crowd. “See you tonight.”

Araci reviews the scan in his visor and compares two overlaid views; the real, burned room, and the original as shown in the floorplan. An augmented reality outline fills in the missing parts of the destroyed oven. Originally a desktop unit, all that remains is the back plane and fuel tank. The paint on the tank is burned, but intact. Everything splays outwards from the oven cavity; the explosion had clearly occurred there.  

Araci retrieves the steak and potatoes meal from the corner of the main room. It's dented, but doesn't leak food goo into his hands. Araci wonders if it's broken. He has no way to test it, he can't afford one of the expensive Hestia ovens; He boils food packets like every other middle-class American. Araci turns the meal box over, shakes it, puts it back on the floor. Normally it produces a perfect dinner. This time, Hestia took an angry turn for the worse.

Lupe’s scan allows for an animated reconstruction of the explosion, tracing the path of the scattered parts back to their original assembly. Araci plays it forward and reverse three times. What happened is clear. Dakota had been standing in front of the oven when it exploded and distributed a high-velocity cloud of sharp plastic, metal, and glass through her and into the room.

As for this condo, there was nothing more. He ships the report to the Portland Police server and leaves the apartment clean-up to the forensics team.

# Introduce Sleuth

## how a meal box works

Araci Belo loves being a detective with the police force. He looks young for a middle-age guy; Lupe finds him attractive. She appreciates his stability and satisfaction with his life; both things she is in search of for herself.

Araci assembles Chicken Piccata, one of the more complex meals available in pouches. He enjoys cooking, the reveal of ingredients from each foil bag, the simple preparation, the assembly. He wasn't dedicated enough to work from raw ingredients, pre-measured pouches was his limit. Still - the smell of onions when they emerge from the saute bag. Squeezing lemon slices on the chicken. Sprinkling capers, salt, and pepper just before plating. Lupe stands near the counter with a glass of wine, watching him fuss with the presentation.

“You should buy one of those ovens,” observes Lupe. “You like cooking. You could make more complex meals.”

“I considered it, but after today, I’m not so sure.” Araci moves the two plates to the table, refills both wine glasses, and invites Lupe. "I've seen the advertisements. Push the meal box into the oven and stand back. Where's the romance?"

"Maybe not romance, but how would you print a steak without one?"

"Print steak how?" asks Araci? "You can't do that at home."

"Right. Not with a packet boiler," says Lupe. "That's the big deal with a Hestia oven. When you push the meal box into the oven, it engages with electricity, a data port and a gas port. The gas from the fuel tank flows into the meal box. The meal box controls the impellers and valves. The oven connects the meal to the outside world. The entire setup is patented."

"So there's a meat printer in the meal box?"

"I know. There just doesn't seem like there's enough room. But the meal opens a valve, meat paste pours out, the oven cooks it, another layer of meat paste, some flavors, more cook. Pretty soon you have a New York steak. Can't do that with foil packets."

"I had no idea," admits Araci. He looks suspiciously at the chicken on his fork. "But here's a question; why gas? Why not just heat with electricity?"

"Good question," says Lupe. She is still enthusiastic about the dinner on her plate. "Hestia can't charge for electricity, but they can sell you overpriced gas canisters. You can't refill a Hestia gas tank; you have to buy a new one. Like ink for printers; you have to buy it from the manufacturer or they won't work."

"I get it," says Araci. He decides to accept the chicken for what it is and takes another bite. "Are you up for ice cream? I bought a tube of cherry chunk."

# Offer Plausible Suspects

## 1st call to Hestia

Araci’s day starts with a call to Hestia, the center of suspicion. His call is met with an artificially intelligent receptionist, projected through his visor as though sitting across him from the desk. 

“Hello Araci Belo,” says the receptionist. It wasn't surprising she knew his name, he was easy to identify from his online presence. “I’m here to help.” The AI exhibits artificial signs of life; her eyes blink, she breathes; but waits, saying nothing more.

“I’d like to speak to the Hestia Product Manager,” replies Araci. 

The receptionist doesn’t hesitate. “I’m sorry, but our product managers are only available by appointment. Can I connect you with our media spokesperson?”

“No. I’m with the Portland Police Department and I’m working on a case involving one of your Hestia ovens.” Araci enunciates and speaks slowly, emphasizing the word ‘Police.’

“One minute please.” the receptionist pauses, then fades to black. In their place appears a dark-haired, middle-age man. He looks up and adjusts something on his desk.

“Hello Mr. Belo. My name is Farj Capcin. I’m told you have some questions.” He waves his hand from off-screen to the center of his view, adding two more individuals. “This is Ms. Broin, our attorney, and Mr. Nilsson, who manages media relations for the Hestia Ovens. Since you are a police representative, we are recording this call. Do you object?”

"Feel free." The prickly reception did not surprise Araci. He’d used his police status to get the receptionist to act, but knew it would put everyone on guard. 

“I’m investigating the death of Dakota Williams...” 

Araci hasn’t finished speaking, but Broin the attorney immediately searches for something. She tappes Farj and points to whatever she found. Farj mutes and turns to Nilsson, then Broin, confers for a minute, then returns to Araci.

“Dakota Williams is a member of Abundancy. We support the idea of unrestricted food for all and have issued several statements regarding our eagerness to work with Abundancy to accomplish this within the bounds of our corporation’s abilities.” 

Farj recited this without hesitation. This was not the first time he had to address issues with the Abundancy group. Araci wondered if the AI receptionist knew the line as well.

Abundancy is news to Araci. Pretending to make a note, he opens a search. 

Abundancy is an activist group; part Greenpeace, part Free Software Foundation, part Earth First, part Right to Repair. They accuse Hestia of trying to patent food, similar to how DuPont and Monsanto hold patents on genetically-modified corn, soybean, and alfalfa. Abundancy argues they will eventually claim rights to any method of combining food to make a meal. 

Abundancy has performed activism against Hestia. They haven’t gone as far as claiming responsibility for breaking windows at Hestia factories, but they have disrupted shareholder meetings and sent letters just shy of threatening bodily harm. Dakota is listed as a volunteer with Abundancy, but doesn't describe her responsibilities.

*Wasn't it strange for Dakota, a volunteer for Abundancy, to own a device from the Great Satan Hestia?*

Araci returns to the conversation. “I understand your desire to work with Abundancy, but I’m more interested in an explosion of one of your devices.”

Farj again mutes and confers, then answers Araci. “We know Ms. Williams owns a Hestia Oven, but that unit has not responded to our status requests for several weeks. Ms. Williams has refused to allow us to provide maintenance, so we aren’t liable.”

“What have you heard about the malfunction?” asks Araci. “Have you determined the cause?”

“We had a team on site and I’m able to supply you with their report,” says Farj. “I suspect you found the same; the oven wasn’t intact, and it was difficult to recover the pieces.”

“So right now, you don’t know what happened?”

“Correct,” answers Farj. “When we do, we’ll be happy to share those findings.”

Araci ended the call. Hestia would not provide any more information, so it made little sense to keep asking. He would need more details before speaking with them again.

## 1st call to abundancy

"Hello, I'm Araci Belo," he says. The AI fielding calls for Abundancy isn't impressed; It might even be broken. There is a virtual puppet projected into his room, only showing a gray outline of a humanoid. It has no face, so the normal signs of life are missing. 

"I'm investigating the death of Dakota Williams," Araci says. 

Nothing.

"I can get a search warrant if necessary," tries Araci. "I can have you audited and put your non-profit status on hold."

Still nothing, but only for a minute. The gray humanoid abruptly acquires  nuances of life. The head tracks Araci's movement; the left hand fidgets. The right hand moves an unseen control. It speaks.

“Detective Araci, we’re not stupid. Please don’t threaten us with legal action you can’t follow up on,” says whoever is behind the puppet. “However, since you’re investigating what happened to Dakota, I want to make sure you’re aware of all the facts.”

“I recently spoke to the Hestia manufacturers,” says Araci. “They mentioned your organization.”

“I’m sure they did. They built their oven to work with their food - and *only* their food. They control the seed, they control the harvest, they control the preparation. It’s proprietary from field to consumer, locking out anyone who wants to do it themselves. That’s wrong and Abundancy is working to prevent it.”

“That’s interesting, but I’m only concerned about Dakota. What was she working on?”

“Dakota was working on her own time and had an interest in the mechanics of the oven and meal boxes. I suggest you look at the financial impact if Hestia were to lose control of their food system. It might be worth killing someone. Not that corporations have ever done anything evil.”

“I appreciate your theories. When you’re ready to speak face to face, please contact me.” Araci ends the call. 

Would a corporation kill to protect intellectual property? Of course they would.

Araci’s visor announces a request from Lupe, which he gladly accepts. “Araci, we’re finding some interesting details in the scan of the condominium explosion. It takes some high resolution, come over to the media lab and see.”

# Introduce Complications

## hacked circuit board

The police media lab isn't much more than a room with desks and high-resolution monitors. The striking feature is the glass wall with a view of the servers. Privacy laws requires this type of data be under actual lock and key, so Araci had to visit in person.

“We had the render machines spend some quality time with the scans and found this interesting difference.” Lupe displays the condominium scan Araci viewed earlier, this time in much higher resolution.

“There are two things you should see,” says Lupe. “Let’s start with the oven reconstruction.”

Lupe waves the room into view, then spreads her hands to enlarge the space where the oven used to be. Spinning her fingers counter-clockwise re-assembles it to its assumed state before the explosion. To the side of the room were two new objects; a circuit board and a meal box.

“Okay, look at this,” Lupe pointed at the back of the oven. "The scan couldn't find any pieces of the oven circuit board, so it left that space empty. But look at this circuit to the side - the scan found parts of it all over the room. I have no doubt it was near - or inside - the oven when it exploded. This isn’t the standard Hestia circuit board. Someone installed a home-built version.”

“Can you move to the bedroom desk?” asks Araci.

The view steps back from the oven, turns, and glides to the bedroom. When Araci had physically been in the room, he had seen circuit boards and electronics. They are visible in the render currently being shown, with the addition of tags identifying the parts.

Many of the tags identified stock electronics. The largest circuit is identified as a Hestia circuit board belonging to the oven in the other room. Lupe points it out. “Dakota took out the Hestia board and installed a home-built version. She was hacking the oven.”

## unknown meal box

“So Dakota wasn't using the oven for food. She was doing research. That’s one mystery partially solved,” says Araci. “You mentioned you had two interesting things to show me?” 

“Yes.” She moves the view to the meal kit hovering next to the mystery circuit board. It is in bad shape with large jagged gaps. 

“Look. Right here,” says Lupe. “This serial number on the meal is only partially identified. But it doesn’t correspond to anything available on the open market. We don’t know where she could have gotten it.”

“A mystery meal in an altered oven,” says Araci. “Operator error compounded by hackery?” He silently ponders the rendered view of the condominium.

# Another Plausible Suspect

## Araci discovers Robin

“What about the bathroom?” asks Lupe. “Toothbrushes. Towels. Did you find the missing roommate?”

“I haven’t had time to search Dakota’s timeline in depth. How about now?” Araci taps his visor and speaks a command. “Display Dakota Williams social history.”

Snippets from Dakota’s life appear in Araci’s visor; he shares them with Lupe. In a video dated January 2059, a man named Robin Lopez first appears. The videos of Dakota and Robin become playful, then intimate, leading up to their move to the condo.

A quick search for Robin Lopez shows he also works for Abundancy. He is the author of ‘The Road To Food Free From Restrictions.’ and Hestia is his nemesis.

“So if they were both with Abundancy and fighting with Hestia, why did they have one in the condo? Maybe Hestia didn’t like what she was doing?” suggests Lupe. “They have all sorts of control over the oven. Can they tell it to explode?”

“Or…maybe Robin didn’t like something Dakota was doing?” adds Araci. “I wonder where he is?” 

# Introduce Private Life

## need to add a day passes…

Dakota's family had already heard about her death. It's impossible for Araci to be the point of first contact when everything is public to everyone. But visiting the family is the most human part of his job - and the most difficult.

Her father lives in a studio apartment. Kids play on the balcony overlooking the urban canyon formed by buildings and streets below. His knock is greeted by an older man, dressed in a light shirt and shorts. "You must be Detective Belo," he says. "I'm Archer Williams. Dakota's father. Please come in."

"I'm sorry to tell you about your daughter's death," says Araci. "She died as the result of an explosion in her home."

"Thank you for your concern. Can I offer you a drink?" Archer mixes powder in water. It fizzes for a moment, after which Araci briefly smells red wine. He accepts the glass and takes a sip to demonstrate his solidarity. 

"To Dakota," says Archer. 

"To your daughter," responds Araci. "We're investigating the explosion now, is there anything we can tell you - or that you would like us to know?"

"Yes, there is." Archer puts down the glass and crosses his arms. "Dakota was a good engineer. Not brilliant, but good enough to accomplish what she needed to do. School wasn't easy for her, she had to work to finish that degree. But it taught her to be careful, persistent, and not to assume her first instinct was correct. That's why I'm surprised she got caught in an explosion. She didn't assume things would work the first, or second time. So she planned for failure."

"I assume you know she was experimenting with the oven?" asks Araci.

"I don't know all the details. She wouldn't tell me because she didn't want me to know what she was doing for Abundancy. That is a strange group. Actually, it is a strange boy. I'm certain Abundancy isn't anything more than a shadow organization run by Robin Lopez."

"I'm looking for Robin. I believe he was living with Dakota. But he's disappeared."

"That doesn't surprise me." Archer picks up the wine and swirls the glass. "Lopez does what he needs to get what he wants. Dakota had a good job she enjoyed. Lopez convinced her to work on his Abundancy project instead. Dakota was careful unless she was with Lopez. Then she moved fast and broke things. Always a bad plan."

"Mr. Williams, if you hear from Robin Lopez, would you let me know?" asks Araci. "And if there is anything else you'd like to know from me, I'll be delighted to tell you."

The sun was setting over the adjoining building when Araci left Archer Williams' apartment. With a bit more dust in the air, it might look like a wilderness landscape. 


# Initial investigation and clues

## hestia vs mystery meal - round 1

Araci opens a call to Hestia. After a bit of wrangling with the AI receptionist, Farj Capcin appears.

“I have a few things I’d like to show you, but you’ll want to do this in person,” says Araci. “If you were to get a seat on the hyperloop, you could be here in time for an afternoon conference. Yes?”

“Normally no,” replies Farj. “But I have a light day and I’m intrigued. Are you buying lunch?”

“Sure. I’ll meet you at the counter in the PDX downtown station.”

------

Araci pays for lunch with Farj and Nilsson, the marketing guy for Hestia. Without time to linger, they catch the light rail to the police media station. Lupe already has the render of the oven displayed, and two boxes to the side.

“We’ve done some forensics, and need your ideas on what we’ve discovered,” explains Araci.

“Do you mind if I explore?” asks Farj. Lupe gives him control of the render and he  rushes to examine the circuit board. “I don’t suppose you have the actual parts of this board?”

“No, but we have something we think is related.” Araci opened the first box, displaying the electronics from Dakota’s desk. “Dakota was working on this, but we’re not sure what it is. We’re hoping you have some insight.”

Farj picks up the box of parts and adjusts his visor, peering at the parts with high magnification. After a minute, Farj turns to Nilsson and makes a brief comment.

“It’s obvious Dakota was attempting to violate our intellectual property and patents,” Farj says to Lupe and Araci. “Much of this is stock components. We do it differently, but the logic is likely the same.”

Araci redirects the conversation. “Let’s look at this other box.”

Araci hands it to Farj; it contains what is left of the meal boxes. “These meal boxes aren’t available on the market. I’m guessing it’s something you are working on and somehow Dakota got a sample.”

Nilsson seemed puzzled, but Farj is alarmed. He leans in with his visor and examines pieces of the exploded meal parts, taking pictures of each. Putting down the box, he adjusts his visor for several minutes. 

Farj sits back. “I’ll explain later,” he tells Nilsson.

“I really can’t talk about this,” Farj tells Araci. 

“Is it something you built? Did Dakota build it?” Araci tries to get an answer from Farj.

“No. I can’t discuss this without a lawyer present.” Farj abruptly stands and motions for Nilsson to do the same. “We need to catch the loop home.”

Araci knows there are plenty of hyperloops back to San Francisco. Farj is making an excuse to leave. Something about the meal has him on edge. They barely have time to end the meeting before Farj and Nilsson are out the door and gone.

“What was that?” asks Lupe.

“A tell,” replies Araci. “A clue. Maybe Abundancy has some ideas.”

## 2nd call to abundancy - robin appears

Araci opens a call on his visor and shares it with Lupe. The same gray puppet appears.

“Um…Dakota Williams, search warrant, audit, non-profit,” says Araci. The puppet pauses, then twitches under human control.

“Detective Belo, what is it now?” The puppet performs an adequate simulation of annoyance.

“We have a question about a meal kit, as well as electronics Dakota put in the oven.”

“I - Abundancy - wouldn’t know anything about that,” says the puppet.

“I’d also like to speak with Robin Lopez,” says Araci. “I believe that would be you.”

The puppet freezes. “I don’t ... Robin isn’t ...,”

“I can get a privacy exemption if necessary,” says Araci. “So, Robin, shall we be real?”

The puppet looks away, then reshapes it’s features. Araci recognizes Robin from Dakota’s videos.

“We wondered where you were,” says Araci. “Hiding after someone dies from an explosion is suspicious - wouldn’t you agree?”

“I’m trying to stay alive,” says Robin. “The explosion was not an accident. I stepped out to get us something to eat and when I got back, there were alarms and smoke. Dakota was dead and whoever caused the explosion might have still been around. I took a quick look, then ran.”

“Okay. You got scared and ran. Let’s accept that for now. But Dakota had installed a custom circuit board in the oven. Wouldn’t that level of tampering with the system cause the explosion? Maybe not an accident; suppose you two brought this on yourselves.”

“NO. We did not.” Robin chokes up. “Dakota was smart. And careful.”

“What was Dakota trying to do with this circuit?” Araci asks.

“It’s not that remarkable - her modification intercepts and logs commands from the meal. We were recording the process. With enough information we could build open source meals. Hestia is tricky about how they make the system work - we were going to open that up to the world. That’s why they killed Dakota.”

“That seems a bit extreme,” starts Araci. “Another question. Where did that meal came from? Would I be able to purchase that from a grocery vendor?”

Robin hesitates. “Not yet.” He looked away for a minute, sighed, and looked back. “That meal wasn’t commercially available. Friends of ours, umm, found it on a shipping dock.”

“So you stole an experimental meal, then stuffed it in a modified oven,” says Araci “This wasn’t a smart thing to do.”

“Hestia wouldn’t create a dangerous meal. The meal had already been tested - they were almost ready to release it. Hestia somehow interfered with it and triggered a bomb. Dakota and I didn’t know that was possible or we wouldn’t have been experimenting with it.”

“So you want me to believe Hestia reached out from the void and triggered an explosion?”

“Is that so hard to believe? They have access to everything. They can upgrade the oven software. They can shut it off. Why wouldn’t they aggressively defend their competitive advantage?”

“Just one more thing,” says Araci. “You said you were getting something to eat. But Dakota was cooking a meal.”

“Dakota was testing to see how the meal worked, not to eat it. Most of the time, the cooking process didn’t work, and the food was inedible. With earlier tests we could see the meal communicate with the oven, but Dakota’s circuit didn’t respond - it just logged the request. The meal assumed everything was fine and proceeded through the process. Most of it came out like old soybeans and congealed fat. Nasty stuff.”

# Disappearance of 1 suspect

# Development of subplot

# Reveal hidden motives

# Unsatisfying solution

## mystery caller (actually Nilsson from marketing)

At home, Araci was helping the robot vacuum when his visor announced a call. It was someone using a privacy puppet.

“Hello Robin,” answers Araci. “Is there something new you’d like to discuss?”

“This isn’t Robin,” says the puppet. “I want to help you review your assumptions about Dakota Williams and Robin Lopez.”

Whoever was driving this animation had access to luxurious bandwidth. Robin’s puppet had been featureless. In comparison, this was a middle-age woman with astonishing detail in her face and hair. Puppets were sometimes only rendered from the waist up; this was a full-body complete with sensible shoes.

“Well, I’ve got a lot of important things to do today.” Araci considers the vacuum cleaner. “But I’m always interested in a mystery. Please continue.”

“You need to consider the meal Dakota was playing with,” she says. “Unfortunately, there isn’t enough of it left for you to examine. If you don’t already know, you can’t buy them. Yet. Dakota’s accident only added an additional round of testing. It’s not going to make a difference; They’re dangerous.” 

She continues, “If you had one, you would have to hire some high-powered electrical engineers and some equally high-powered food engineers, then do months of research to figure out what’s unusual about it.”

Araci sends the robot off to the kitchen. “You’re making a lot of claims and you tell me I don’t have the wattage to check your work. I’ll state the obvious; why should I trust you?”

“Because I work for Hestia,” says the woman. “These new meals are going to get us in trouble, but I’m unable to convince anyone we should stop the project. I’m hoping your investigation will make an impression on Hestia.”

The woman produces a meal box from... somewhere. It was a virtual sleight-of-hand, if such a thing could exist. “I’ve sent you one of these meal boxes. When you get it, you’ll be able to prove what I’m about to show you.” She holds the meal in front of Araci. It doubles in size, then changes to a cutaway view. It is a starburst pattern of food cavities, channels, pumps, valves, and electronics. A chip throbs with a blue outline.

“This chip, the one outlined in blue light, is a new concept for meals. It’s full-blown artificial intelligence. It doesn’t make the meal sing or dance. It just solves problems - like any other AI. But it does two special things: first, it confirms the food preparation process is going according to plan. If not, it adjusts the recipe to recover. Second, it sends that learning back to our server.”

Araci sits down. The woman puppet takes a step closer and also sits, a chair materializing under her. A perfectly smooth animation; Araci forgot he was talking to thin air. 

“I assume all Hestia meals communicate back to the network,” says Araci.

“True. But we only collect what’s legal. Privacy laws restrict what can be recorded. This new meal dodges that restriction. It doesn’t record the actions from the user; it records the actions of the AI. The AI responds to the oven and the user. See the difference?”

“That’s a slim distinction. It sounds like something a judge would be interested in discussing.”

“Try Congress and legislation,” she says. “This is a game changer and not just for food.”

“Sounds like a job for a lobbyist. But back to what matters; I’m interested in what - or who - blew up Dakota.”

The puppet puts the meal back to wherever it had appeared from. “It’s the AI. We can’t test it because we don’t have Dakota’s circuit and the telemetry it sent is confused. We’re certain when she put this meal in the oven the AI tried to control things. The oven didn’t respond predictably, so the AI improvised. Somehow the AI decided it needed to open the gas valve. But the gas valve was already open. Dakota’s circuit gave the AI inaccurate information.”

She opens up a window with a diagram of AI logic. None of it makes sense to Araci, but it was something he could provide to the Police programming team.

“The meal must have allowed the tank to discharge the entire volume of gas. But the AI didn’t know, so it sparked an igniter. If we release these meals without understanding the risks, consumers won't trust Hestia or any of their products, let alone the ovens.”

"Maybe Dakota wasn't wrong," says Araci. "She may have been doing something unexpected, but that's the nature of people. If your product doesn't like that, maybe you ought to check your design?"

"You and I agree on that," she says.

# Return to overlooked clue

## sushi exposition

“*irasshaimase!*”

The video screens scattered around the bar show a cartoon sushi chef cheerfully welcoming Araci and Lupe. Four segments of a donut-shaped platform in the center of their table drop out of sight, one at a time, then rise up bearing drinks or food. 


Araci retrieves a beer, Lupe an old-fashioned; The empty squares drop out of site, then return with a bowl of peanuts and a salad. A robotic chef at the side of the room whirs, mixing drinks and chopping food. It's programmed to present Araci and Lupe with the most profitable menu.

“So. Whodunit?” asks Araci. “Robin thinks it was the friendly folks at Hestia. My mystery caller from Hestia thinks Dakota precipitated a fatal acccident.”

Lupe squeezes the orange in her drink, bites off the fruit, then drops the peel in the garbage hole in the middle of the table. A slight vacuum pulls it away. “What if Robin did it? He was suspiciously absent.”

“He might have had the opportunity, but why? Seems like Dakota and Robin were on the same team, both for Abundancy and in a relationship.”

“I’ll agree. But I don’t think anything Dakota did was enough to light things up. Seems like her circuit was fail-safe. If something didn’t seem right, it would just log the request.”

Araci picks up the peanuts, then moves to put them back down. Too late; they are charged to his tab and the platform drops away, reappearing with a crudité platter. He surrenders and shells a peanut. “That leaves us with Hestia. But I’m not convinced Farj is a killer.”

## need to end this scene.

## araci and robin test crazy theories

Araci’s next call to Abundancy is easier; Robin answers immediately. 

“I’m going to need some help testing some crazy theories,” said Araci. “You’ve got the knowledge to understand the internals of this problem and you might be interested in the corporate side. Would you care to meet with me?”

Robin - who no longer used a puppet - checked something off-screen. “I have access to a Hestia oven and a copy of the board Dakota was playing with. Is that the sort of setup you’re looking for?”

“Close enough,” replied Araci. “Let’s meet. I’ll bring a meal.”

// -----

Araci summoned a public car and directed it to the location Robin mentioned; an artist’s building, four floors of small studios all wrapped up in one big fire hazard. He knocked on the door of room 327 and met Robin face-to-face for the first time.

“I brought dinner,” said Araci. He held out the meal sent by his anonymous lady friend.

“How convenient,” replied Robin. “I’ve got an oven.”

Robin ushered Araci into an open room with no windows. Steel columns braced the walls in a minimally legal attempt to be earthquake proof. The oven stood in the back of the room, a comfortable distance in front of a long workbench. There were wires - actual wires - running from the oven and connected to extensive test gear. 

“I’m going to assume this is all legal and code-compliant,” said Araci. “At least, I won’t ask, so please don’t tell.”

Robin looked at him, saying nothing. After a moment, he powered up the oven and displays on the workbench. They reflected frantic communication coming from the oven, but Araci could not decipher what it meant. 

“What are we testing?” asked Robin.

“One of my recent best friends called,” said Araci. “They said the meal has an AI chip that didn’t enjoy talking to Dakota’s custom board. They think the explosion resulted from a miscommunication.”

“We didn’t even think there might be AI in the meal. That’s serious engineering; way more than we gave WorldFoods credit for. Let’s look.”

“Whoa - before you connect this up, are we going to die in an unplanned fire?” Araci held back. “I’d like to avoid that.”

Robin pointed at a display on the bench. “I’ve removed the propane tank and simulated the gas pressure. The meal should be happier about the oven response.” 

Araci surrendered the meal to Robin and took a precautionary step back from the project. Robin  placed the meal inside the oven.

The previously frantic displays became a blur. Robin went back to the workbench, tapped a control once, then twice. The display converted to a summary, showing an overview of the oven’s activities.

“Oh - look at that!” Robin watched a display of flashing boxes and lines. He looked at Araci, realizing a better explanation was necessary. “It’s the meal talking to the oven. There’s so much more than Dakota expected. The AI explains a lot when you know to look for it.”

Araci could only guess at the story Robin was watching. Three displays jittered with confusing diagnostics; Robin bounced from one station on the workbench to another.

With all the activity happening on screen, it was misleading to think of something suddenly changing - but it did. One screen froze. Another changed its layout. The third continued, but at one-half the speed. Robin stepped back and looked at the oven. “What are you doing?” he asked. Not to Araci - to the oven.

Robin slapped a large red button straight out of a comic book. The workbench and oven abruptly shut down. He turned to face Araci.

“This was not an accident happening between the oven and the meal,” said Robin. He hesitated and twitched. He paced, checking inactive displays and tracing wires. “The meal just tried to start a fire. Not just turn on the oven - it tried to blow the entire room to pieces. It told the oven to release a huge volume of gas then to ignite. It was deliberate.”

Robin reset the “big red button” then waved up some log files, sharing them with Araci. 

“Here. Right here,” Robin pointed at a paragraph in the narrative log. “The AI decides it’s being reverse-engineered. It knows what’s going on - someone programmed it to watch for this. It’s trying to self-destruct, just like a piece of military hardware might do when it winds up in enemy hands. That’s a hell of a way to protect intellectual property.”

“WorldFoods did this?” asked Araci.

“This is a WorldFood meal, so yes. But if WorldFood is doing it, then Hestia surely knows about it. Hestia will view that as permission to do the same. After that, AI defense of intellectual property will be pervasive.”

“Isn’t this all a bit extreme?” asked Araci. “Exploding ovens are going to attract attention. That would be a publicity nightmare. Not to mention liability.”

“You’d think so,” said Robin. “But we’re talking about AI. Not linear algorithims. You never know what the layers and nodes are doing. It might act when it decides it’s being reverse-engineered. It’s just as possible the AI could decide to terminate because a location doesn’t have solid IP laws. Or who knows. AIs make conclusions without human guidance. But they don’t have a value for self-worth, so they can choose self-immolation as the low-cost option to protect the programming.”

Robin continued. “I’m speculating, but if Hestia decides it’s ok for a meal to self-destruct, they might also decide it’s ok for an oven to self-destruct. This oven already has low-grade AI for trouble-shooting and self-maintenance. It wouldn’t be difficult to put in a higher-level AI to detect a non-approved meal kit. You could even have two AIs - one in a rogue meal and one in the oven - and they’d be kick-boxing with each other. God help the poor schmuck standing nearby.”

Araci understood. This wasn’t just about Dakota anymore.

## araci confronts hestia

Farj, Broin, and Nilsson seated themselves in the same spots as the last time they visited the police media lab. Lupe was running a visual of the Hestia oven and a scrolling display of some active computer logic. Araci admired the setup. 

He began. “Thanks for joining us. As I mentioned, our research identified some behaviors we don’t understand. Let me show you a demonstration, then I’ve got a few questions.”

Araci motioned to Lupe, who produced the WorldFood kit and placed it on the table. The oven graphic showed a connection with the meal and behind the glass wall, the servers absolutely blazed with activity. Lupe paused the code.

“The last time we met, I knew little about what Dakota was doing. I didn’t realize she had an experimental meal from one of your competitors. But I suspect you realized that when you saw the serial number and made your abrupt exit.”

Farj looked at Nilsson and Broin; they only looked back. They had obviously discussed this between themselves already.

“This meal,” Araci showed the WorldFood meal on the table, “is like the one Dakota placed in her modified Hestia oven. We’ve learned it contains artificial intelligence to enable it to override blocks placed by the Hestia oven. Lupe, please continue the simulation.”

Lupe released the pause on the code and several indicators immediately jumped, then displayed “Out Of Range” or “Process Termination” errors. The simulation stopped, and the servers quieted down.

“You’ll excuse me for this underwhelming demonstration,” said Araci. “It would have been more impressive to run this on an actual Hestia oven, but we don’t have explosion-proof rooms in this station. As such, we’ve just seen a simulation of what happens when one of these unknown meals talks with a Hestia Oven in a diagnostic mode. The meal instructs the oven to stop attempts at reverse-engineering. If the oven doesn’t stop, the meal fights back. We believe this happened to Dakota Williams.”

“Hestia would never instruct an AI to react like this,” interjected Ms. Broin. “It’s bad corporate relations and speaking for the Hestia legal department, it’s not something we would advise.”

“See, that’s the thing,” replied Araci. “You don’t tell an AI how to behave. AI chooses from options. You just provide desired endpoints. Here, a *manufacturer* - and by manufacturer, I mean *you* - only needs to instruct the AI of the problem, then sit back and let it sort out the best resolution. If you don’t restrict it from a specific method, it remains a viable choice.”

Farj was tapping his foot. Araci read it as a nervous twitch and evidence he was making his point.

“Defensive AI in a meal is one thing,” Araci said, “defensive AI in an oven is another.” Araci addressed his statements directly to Farj. “If an oven were equipped with AI that obstructed competitive meals, and that oven was involved in suspicious events, well, that would be *problematic*. Do you see what I’m saying?”

Farj looked at Broin, who shook her head *No!* The unspoken communication was clear; Hestia had already been engaged in exactly this type of project. Now they were on notice. Nilsson was fidgeting; Araci could only imagine he was planning how to address this at a shareholder meeting.

“I think we understand your point,” said Farj. “We are limited in our ability to discuss this at length. I assume we’ll be in touch if you have other concerns.”

Araci and Lupe shook hands with their departing guests. When the room was empty, Araci spoke to Lupe; “Do you want to listen to this next call?”

“Wouldn’t miss it for the world,” Lupe said.

## araci sets robin in motion

Araci connected with Abundancy and Robin, then looped in Lupe. “Robin, I just had an interesting conversation with some mutual friends about ovens and meals and AI. As a government entity, it would be irresponsible of me to publish unfounded opinions that might lead to damaging rumors. But if *someone* were to file a freedom of information request regarding police investigation of the death of Dakota Williams, they might learn something they would want to share. It could head off some unfortunate product enhancements to meal kits and ovens.”

“Thanks,” said Robin. “It’s a costly lesson, but I think Dakota would have approved. I’ll follow up on your suggestion.”

Araci and Lupe ended the call. “I’m sorry to close the investigation,” said Araci “Dakota will have died in a freak accident - no murder charges. But hopefully this puts an end to anything like this.”

“I don’t know,” said Lupe. “We humans are always looking for novel ways to kill ourselves.” She stood. “I’m hungry, let’s get lunch. I’ve heard of a new Iraqi restaurant.”

##  Getting Rid of Ransomware

“He doesn’t have to be. What if a third party acted out of self-interest?” Lupe paused and stared at Araci. “Just a minute,” she said. She waved up a search window in her visor and concentrated. With a slight nod, she shared the results with Araci.

Araci saw Lupe’s search. It started with Dakota’s resume. It jumped to her previous ransomware employer. A hop over to corporate relationships produced an organization tree. On the tree, the ransomware company was highlighted, as was the line leading up the tree to the parent, then down a branch - which led to Hestia.

“Dakota was reverse-engineering intellectual property belonging to a sibling of her previous employer,” Lupe pointed out. “Whether she knew it, she was messing around with a relative of a ransomware company - a company with flexible ethics, and a company that knew where to find her. Farj might not have pulled the trigger, but he knew people that would.”

“For that, I’m buying tonight’s drinks,” said Araci. “It fits. All that’s left to do is mountains of paperwork, but I think you’re on-target.”

If Lupe or Araci didn’t take an offering from one of the mini-elevators, it would periodically drop and return with something else, making a guess at what they would find tempting.
