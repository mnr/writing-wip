Two decades after the earthquake, downtown Portland is almost cleared of debris. New buildings rise to optimistic heights and the Willamette river flows to the Columbia. Detective Araci Belo considered the view for a full half-minute, then shifted his focus to the shattered glass. The room he stands in is on the 33rd floor of a luxury condominium built by the city. The hope is to attract business and dispel the perception of Portland as a disaster zone. 

An explosion had propelled bits of the oven from the back of the condominium. Nothing had broken through the window. They were earthquake-proof, designed not to shred the pedestrians below with lethal glass daggers. Despite the cracks and bulls-eyes, they were the most intact feature of this room.

Besides Araci, there were two fire inspectors, a police imaging technician  (“Lupe”), two appliance maintenance people, a building administrator, and her assistant. Three home owners’ association board members and neighbors on all sides of this condo stood in the hallway.

The sweet, meaty smell of burnt flesh emanated from Dakota Williams, the recently deceased occupant of the condominium. She lay on her back in the middle of the room; her severed right arm near the earthquake pillar. Her left forearm leaned against the door. The explosion had burned through her clothing and bits of face, hair, and scalp stuck to the window. 

Araci stepped around Dakota and through the door to other half of the condominium, leading to the bedroom and bath. The bathroom was tidy, but not spotless. There were two toothbrushes in a cup, enough used towels for two people.

He stepped out and into the bedroom. Electronic parts cluttered a small desk.Meters, breadboards, wires; all things an electronics engineer might use. The bed was neat, the floor was picked up except for a few kitchen utensils thrown in by the explosion.

Araci pulled up Dakota’s publicly shared digital records which included pictures of her living in Montevideo, always smiling, often in a plaza. In a video dated January 2059, a boy named Robin Lopez appeared. Araci traced Robin back to Portland, Oregon. He had visited Montevideo for an open source software convention. That spring, Dakota boarded a plane to Portland for a long weekend. A month later Robin returned to Montevideo and frolicked at Playa de Los Pocitos in daylight - danced at night. The videos became playful and intimate, leading up to Dakota’s move to Portland. 

In Montevideo, she worked for a publically held ransomware company. Her resume listed her as a consultant with “Abundancy,” a non-profit involved in food advocacy. It was part Greenpeace, part Free Software Foundation, part Earth First, part Right to Repair. Her job duties weren't clearly described.

Robin Lopez also worked for Abundancy. Araci could request a DNA test, but Robin surely owned the second toothbrush. His absence in this room was a gaping hole in the narrative. He wasn’t a man of mystery; he had his own complete internet story. But he picked an interesting moment to go missing. Araci made a note to find him.

“The scan is ready,” said Officer Guadalupe Reyes. She pushed a few buttons on the back of a camera. “I’ve put the render in the report folder. You interested in grabbing some dinner tonight?” 

*Guadalupe* - sometimes “Lupe” - was Araci’s sparring partner in the Portland Police self-defense class. Their relationship was professional, although there were signals something more might be possible. 

“Sure. Six pm?” replied Araci. "Come to my place and I'll make you a dinner that doesn't explode."

“You are such a buzzkill. I was hoping for something exciting.” She grabbed her bags and pushed through the crowd. "See you tonight."

Araci retrieved the scan in his visor and re-surveyed the room, comparing the two overlaid views; the real, burned room, and the original as shown in blueprints. An augmented reality outline filled in the missing parts of the destroyed counter. The oven had an overlay of what it looked like before the explosion. All that remained was the back plane and fuel tank. The paint on the tank had burned, but it was intact. Everything splayed outwards from the oven cavity; the explosion had clearly occurred there. 

The oven, a “Hestia” model, was designed to be easy to install and use. It was self-contained and the built-in propane tank avoided the need to pipe in gas. It had no controls, instead, instructions from a meal packet controlled it. A meal package comprised a multi-chambered cook plate with valves driven by a micro controller. The chambers contained ingredients. The controller opened valves at the proper time, communicating with the oven for temperature change. Just place a meal kit in the oven and stand back. Normally it produced a perfect dinner. This time, Hestia had taken an angry turn for the worst.

Abundancy had performed some violent activism against Hestia. They hadn’t gone as far as claiming responsibility for breaking windows at Hestia factories, but they had disrupted shareholder meetings and sent letters just shy of threatening bodily harm. Abundancy felt Hestia was trying to patent food. Hestia did hold patents on the meal kits for their oven, but Abundancy felt this was a slippery slope. DuPont and Monsanto held patents on genetically-modified corn, soybean, and alfalfa. They defended these patents with wide-ranging arguments that caught up anyone using non-GMO variants. Abundancy argued Hestia was following the same strategy and would eventually claim rights to any method of combining food to make a meal. 

Lupe’s scan allowed for an animated reconstruction of the explosion, tracing the path of the scattered parts back to their original assembly. Araci played it forward and reverse three times. What happened was clear. Dakota had been standing in front of the oven when it exploded and distributed a high-velocity cloud of sharp plastic, metal, and glass shrapnel through her and into the room.

As for this condo, there was nothing more. He shipped the report to the Portland Police server and left the apartment clean-up to the forensics team.

Araci assembled Chicken Piccata, one of the complex meals available in pouches. He enjoyed cooking, the reveal of ingredients from each foil bag, the simple preparation, the assembly. The smell of onions when they emerged from the saute bag. Squeezing lemon slices on the chicken. Sprinkling capers, salt, and pepper just before plating. Lupe stood near the counter with a glass of wine, watching him fuss with the presentation.

"You should buy one of those ovens," observed Lupe. "You like cooking. You could make more complex meals."

"I considered it, but after today, I'm not so sure." Araci moved the two plates to the table, refilled both wine glasses, and invited Lupe to the table. "Besides, they only work with proprietary meals. It's not like you can just whip up some batter and bake a cake. You have to buy a kit - from Hestia - or it doesn't work. You're not allowed to do anything except put it in, then take it out."

"I suppose," replied Lupe. "Did you find out more about the missing boyfriend?"

"How do you know there was a boyfriend?"

"Oh come on. Two toothbrushes. Multiple towels. Boxers and bras in the laundry."

Araci hadn't thought to look in the laundry. "I suspect we're looking for Robin Lopez. He's the author of 'The Road To Food Free From Restrictions.' He is upset about Hestia's food patents. He and Dakota were both connected with Abundancy."

"So if they were fighting with Hestia, why did they have an oven?" Lupe sliced off a piece of chicken, dipped it in the sauce, took a bite. "Ummm. This is so much better than the one-bag meal I had planned for dinner."

"I'm puzzled by that too," agreed Araci. "It's odd they had an oven. It's odd it exploded. It's odd Robin is missing."

Araci continued; "There's other parts of their story that don't settle. Dakota left a job with a ransomware company. Ransomware may have manuevered itself into a measure of respectability, but just because they're public and produce respectable profits for retiree accounts doesn't erase the fact they are involved in insurance fraud. Insurance companies don't like extortion. Would an employee be allowed to just quit and walk away? Dakota could flip and inform insurance. She could work for a competitor. It wasn't long between her departure from Montevideo and her departure from this world. Maybe her former employer blew her up?"

"Maybe Hestia didn't like what she was doing for Abundancy?" suggested Lupe. "They have all sorts of control over the oven. Maybe they can tell it to explode?"

"That's an interesting idea," said Araci. "I'll make a few calls tomorrow. Should I snap open this ice cream?"

// -----

Araci’s call to Hestia’s manufacturer met with an artificially intelligent receptionist, projected through his visor as sitting across from him at the table. 

“Hello Araci Belo,” said the receptionist. “I’m here to help.” The AI exhibited artificial signs of life, but waited, saying nothing more.

“I’d like to speak to the Hestia Product Manager,” replied Araci. 

The receptionist didn’t hesitate. “I’m sorry, but our product managers are only available by appointment. Can I connect you with our media spokesperson?”

“No. I’m with the Portland Police Department and I’m working on a case involving one of your Hestia ovens.” Araci enunciated and spoke slowly, emphasizing the word ‘Police.’

“One minute please.” the receptionist paused, then faded to black. In their place appeared a dark-haired, middle-age man. He looked up and adjusted something on his desk.

“Hello Mr. Belo. My name is Farj Capcin. I’m told you have some questions.” He waved his hand from off-screen to the center of his view, adding two more individuals. “This is Ms. Broin, our attorney, and Mr. Nilsson, who manages media relations for the Hestia Ovens. Since you are a police representative, we are recording this call. Do you object?”

The prickly reception did not surprise Araci. He’d used his police status to get the receptionist to act, but knew it would put everyone on guard. 

“I’m investigating the death of Dakota Williams...” 

Araci hadn’t finished speaking, but Broin the attorney immediately searched for something. She tapped Farj and pointed to whatever she had found. Farj muted and turned to Nilsson, then Broin, conferred for a minute, then returned to Araci.

“Dakota Williams is a member of Abundancy. We support the idea of unrestricted food for all and have issued several statements regarding our desire to work with Abundancy to accomplish this within the bounds of our corporation’s abilities.” 

Farj recited this without hesitation. This was not the first time he had to address issues with the Abundancy group. Araci wondered if the AI receptionist knew the line as well.

Araci tried again. “I understand your desire to work with Abundancy, but I’m more interested in an explosion of one of your devices.”

Araci made notes; Farj, Broin, and Nilsson knew about Dakota Williams. They knew she was working with Abundancy. They didn’t act surprised to hear of her death. Araci pursued a hunch.

“I’m also investigating the whereabouts of Robin Lopez.”

Farj again muted and conferred, then answered Araci. “We can’t speculate on the relationship between Ms. Williams and Mr. Lopez. We know Ms. Williams owns a Hestia Oven, but that unit has not responded to our pings for several weeks. Ms. Williams has refused to allow us to provide maintenance, so we aren’t liable.”

“What have you heard about the malfunction?” asked Araci. “Have you determined the cause?”

“We had a team on site and I’m able to supply you with their report,” said Farj. “They noted you were there. I suspect you found the same; the oven wasn’t intact, and it was difficult to recover the pieces.”

“So right now, you don’t know what happened?”

“Correct,” answered Farj. “When we do, we’ll be happy to share those findings.”

Araci ended the call. Hestia would not provide any more information, so it made little sense to keep asking. He would need more details before speaking with them again.

// -----

His next call was to Abundancy. He spent the better part of an hour trying to make contact. It wasn’t until he challenged one of the AI call handlers with a non-specific police action that he made any progress. Legally, he couldn’t do anything, but he used the right combination of keywords to trigger the AI to summon a live person. A screen puppet appeared, their face obscured with a synthesized privacy mask.

“Detective Araci, we’re not stupid. Please don’t threaten us with legal action you can’t follow up on,” said whoever was behind the mask. “However, since you’re investigating what happened to Dakota, I want to make sure you’re aware of all the facts.”

“I recently spoke to the Hestia manufacturers,” said Araci. “They mentioned your organization.”

“I’m sure they did. They are using Dakota as an example of why food needs to be patented. They built their oven to work with their food trays - and *only* their food trays. They control the seed, they control the harvest, they control the preparation. It’s proprietary from field to consumer, locking out anyone who wants to do it themselves. That's wrong and Abundancy is working to prevent it.”

“That’s interesting, but I’m only concerned about Dakota. Was she working on something related to Abundancy?”

“Dakota may have been reverse-engineering the oven and food API. But that’s Hestia intellectual property and I can’t condone illegal behavior. I can suggest you look at the financial impact if Hestia were to lose control of their food system. It might be worth killing someone. Not that corporations have ever done anything evil.”

“I appreciate your theories. When you’re ready to speak face to face, please contact me.” Araci ended the call. 

Would a corporation kill to protect intellectual property? Of course they would.

Araci’s visor announced a request from Lupe, which he gladly accepted. “Araci, we’re finding some interesting details in the scan of the condominium explosion. It takes some high resolution, come over to the media lab and see.”

// -----

The police media lab wasn’t much more than a room with desks and high-resolution monitors. The striking feature was the glass wall with a view of the servers. Privacy laws controlled this type of data under actual lock and key, so Araci had to visit in person.

“We had the render machines spend some quality time with the scans and found this interesting difference.” Lupe displayed the condominium scan Araci viewed earlier, this time in much higher resolution.

“There are two things you should see,” said Lupe. “Let’s start with the oven reconstruction.”

Lupe waved the room into view, then spread her hands to enlarge the space where the oven used to be. Spinning her fingers counter-clockwise re-assembled it to its assumed state before the explosion.

Lupe stopped the motion. “Okay, look right here. Do you see the circuits coming back together?” Lupe pointed at a green circuit board appearing in the oven. Parts were missing; the reconstruction could only do so much.

“This isn’t the standard Hestia circuit board. Someone installed a home-built version.”

“Can you move to the bedroom desk?” asked Araci.

The view stepped back from the oven, turned, and glided to the bedroom. When Araci had physically been in the room, he had seen circuit boards and electronics. They were visible in the render currently being shown, with the addition of tags identifying the parts.

“What is all of this?”

Lupe selected several of the components and split the screen. She moved back to the reconstruction of the oven and the circuit board. Some chips were only partially viewable; the known circuits were filled in from manufacturer specifications. Lupe overlaid the components on the oven circuit. They lined up perfectly. 

“Well. Dakota was installing custom electronics.” Lupe saved the overlay. “She was hacking the oven. I'd guess she used the oven to test a home-built circuit.”

“That’s one mystery partially solved,” said Araci. “You mentioned you had two interesting things to show me?” 

“Yes, and I’ll resist making a stupid double entendre joke about showing you two things.” She laughed, then moved the view to the heating cavity of the oven, cutting through the external walls like X-Ray vision. Inside was a meal tray, but in worse shape than the circuit board. Bits of the tray were visible in the reconstruction. Large jagged gaps showed where missing pieces would go. 

“Look here,” said Lupe. “This serial number on the meal is only partially identified. But it doesn’t correspond to anything available on the open market. We don’t know where she could have gotten it.”

“A mystery meal in an altered oven,” said Araci. “Operator error compounded by hackery?” He silently pondered the rendered view of the condominium.

// -----

Araci opened a call to Hestia. After a bit of wrangling with the AI receptionist, Farj Capcin appeared.

“I have a few things I’d like to show you, but you’ll want to do this in person,” said Araci. “If you were to get a seat on the hyperloop, you could be here in time for an afternoon conference. Yes?”

“Normally no,” replied Farj. “But I have a light day and I’m intrigued. Are you buying lunch?”

“Sure. I’ll meet you at the counter in the PDX downtown station.”

// -----

Araci paid for lunch with Farj and Nilsson, the marketing guy for Hestia. Without time to linger, they caught the light rail to the police media station. Lupe already had the render of the oven displayed, and two boxes were arranged to the side.

“We’ve done some forensics, and need your ideas on what we’ve discovered,” explained Araci. “You’ve probably created a similar scan of your own, but this is what we are looking at.”

“Do you mind if I explore?” asked Farj. Lupe gave him control of the render. As Lupe had done yesterday, Farj moved past the outside shell of the oven and examined the circuit board.

“This is an amazing view. Must be quite the render farm behind this.” Farj looked beyond the window at the room full of computers. Araci noted several of the racks were frantically blinking; this virtual oven consumed megawatts of computations.

“I don’t suppose you have the actual parts of this board?” asked Farj.

“No, but we have something we think is related.” Araci opened the first box, displaying the electronics from Dakota’s desk. “Dakota was working on this, but we’re not sure what it is. We’re hoping you have some insight.”

Farj picked up the box and adjusted his visor. After a minute, Farj turned to Nilsson and made a brief comment.

“It’s obvious Dakota was attempting to violate our intellectual property and patents,” Farj said to Lupe and Araci. “Much of this is stock components and duplicates of the parts shown on the circuit board in the oven. We do it differently, but the logic is likely the same.”

“How does Hestia feel about this custom circuit board?” asked Araci.

Nilsson replied. “We don’t like it. It violates the user agreement.”

Araci redirected the conversation. “Let’s look at this other box.”

Araci opened the smaller box; it contained what was left of the meal kit. He passed it to Farj. 

“This meal isn’t available on the market. I’m guessing it’s something you are working on privately and somehow Dakota got a sample.”

Nilsson seemed puzzled, but Farj was alarmed. He leaned in with his visor and examined every piece of the exploded meal parts, taking pictures of each. Putting down the box, he adjusted the view in his visor for several minutes. It was clear he was assembling a virtual reconstruction, but none of what he was doing was visible to Araci or Lupe.

Farj sat back. “I’ll explain later,” he told Nilsson.

“I really can’t talk about this,” Farj told Araci. 

“Is it something you built? Did Dakota build it?” Araci tried to get an answer from Farj.

“No. I can’t discuss this without a lawyer present.” Farj abruptly stood and motioned for Nilsson to do the same. “We need to catch the loop home.”

Araci knew there were plenty of hyperloops back to San Francisco. Farj was making an excuse to leave. Something about the meal had him on edge. They barely had time to end the meeting before Farj and Nilsson were out the door and gone.

“What was that?” asked Lupe.

“A tell,” replied Araci. “A clue. Maybe my other friend has some ideas.”

Araci opened a call on his visor and shared it with Lupe. Abundancy’s AI was more resistant than Hestia, but after Araci made the same baseless threat, it again connected him to the anonymized puppet.

“Detective Belo, what is it now?” The puppet performed an adequate simulation of annoyance.

“We have a question about a meal kit, as well as electronics Dakota put in the oven.”

“I - Abundancy - wouldn’t know anything about that,” said the puppet.

“I’d also like to speak with Robin Lopez,” said Araci. “I believe that would be you.”

The puppet froze. “I don’t ... Robin isn’t ...,”

“I can get a privacy exemption if necessary,” said Araci. “If I have to do that, I’ll include Abundancy and Dakota. So, Robin, shall we talk face to face?”

The puppet looked away, then made a gesture to pull its face off. Araci recognized Robin from Dakota’s videos of Montevideo.

“I’m trying to stay alive,” said Robin. “The explosion was not an accident. I stepped out to get us something to eat and when I got back, there were alarms and smoke. I took a quick look, then ran. Dakota wasn’t moving and whoever caused the explosion might have still been around.”

“Okay. You were scared and ran. Let’s accept that for now. But Dakota had installed a custom circuit board in the oven. Wouldn’t that level of tampering with the system be suspected to cause the explosion? Suppose you two brought this on yourselves.”

“NO. We did not.” Robin choked up. “Dakota was smart. And careful. She built in a fail-safe sensor. The meal she had in the oven was from a reputable manufacturer. It wasn’t like we were cooking meth.”

“There’s a lot to unpack here,” Araci said. “Do you have the schematic?”

“I can get it. It’s not that remarkable - the board intercepts and logs commands from the meal. We were recording the process. With enough information we could build open source meals. Hestia is tricky about how they make the system work - we were going to open that up to the world. What we’re doing is legal, but they heard we were succeeding. That’s why they killed Dakota.”

“How do you suppose Hestia caused the explosion?”

“How should I know?” said Robin. “You’re the police. Isn’t this what you do?”

“Thanks for your confidence and help,” said Lupe.

“Next question,” started Araci. “You said the meal was from - and I quote: ‘a reputable manufacturer.’ Can we come to an agreement on where that meal came from? Would I be able to purchase that from a grocery vendor? “

Robin hesitated. “Not yet.” He looked away for a minute, sighed, and looked back. “That particular meal wasn’t commercially available. Friends of mine obtained it from WorldFood. We’re not the only group attempting to break Hestia’s food monopoly. Dakota said we could compare the behavior of the WorldFood meal against a standard Hestia meal for insight on how the system worked.”

“WorldFood makes meal kits for Hestia?” asked Araci.

“WorldFood makes generic meals for pouch heaters. Nothing with microcontrollers. Until now. But they know there’re profits to be made if they can supply an alternative to Hestia.”

“So you stole an experimental meal from a competitor, then stuffed it in a modified oven,” said Araci “Maybe this wasn’t a smart thing to do.”

“Wrong. Nobody would create an exploding meal. That would just be stupid. The WorldFood meal had already been tested - they were almost ready to release it. It was *found* on a shipping dock, going out for the last round of certification. WorldFood was moving on Hestia’s market with their brand of meals. We were moving on Hestia with open source meals.”

“So you’re saying Hestia reached out from the void and triggered an explosion?”

“Is that so hard to believe? They have access to everything. They can upgrade the oven software. They can shut it off. Why couldn’t they explosively defend their competitive advantage?”

“Just one more thing,” said Araci. “You said you were getting something to eat. But Dakota was cooking a meal.”

“Dakota was testing to see how the meal worked, not to eat it. Most of the time, the cooking process didn’t work, and the food was inedible. With earlier tests of Hestia proprietary products, we could see the meal communicate with the oven, but Dakota’s circuit didn’t respond - it just logged the request. The meal assumed everything was fine and proceeded through the process. Most of it came out like old soybeans and congealed fat. Nasty stuff.”

Araci looked at Lupe. There was a lot to untangle. Maybe they could compare notes after work.

// -----

“*irasshaimase!*”

The video screens scattered around the bar showed a cartoon sushi chef cheerfully welcoming them. Lupe and Araci sat at an unoccupied table and food immediately appeared. Four segments of a donut-shaped platform in the center of the table sequentially dropped out of sight, then raised up bearing drinks or food. If Lupe or Araci didn’t take an offering from one of the mini-elevators, it would periodically drop and return with something else, making a guess at what they would find tempting. The donut hole was for garbage. Drop something in - trash, drinks, plates, silverware, anything - and a quiet vacuum pulled it away.

Araci retrieved a beer, Lupe an old-fashioned, and the empty squares replenished with a bowl of peanuts and a salad. A robotic chef at the side of the room whirred, mixed drinks, and chopped food, trying to outguess Araci and Lupe with the most profitable menu.

“So. Whodunit?” asked Araci. “Was it the friendly folks at Hestia? Or did Dakota screw up?”

Lupe squeezed the orange in her drink, bit off the fruit, then dropped the peel in the garbage chute. Whoosh and gone. “For the sake of thinking out of the box, what if Robin did it? He was suspiciously absent.”

“He might have had the opportunity, but why would he do it? Seems like Dakota and Robin were on the same team, both for Abundancy and in a relationship.”

“I’ll agree. But I don’t think anything Dakota did was enough to light things up. Seems like her circuit was fail-safe. If something didn’t seem right, it would just log the request.”

Araci picked up the peanuts, then moved to put them back down. Too late; they were charged to his tab, and the platform dropped away, reappearing with a crudité platter. He surrendered and shelled a peanut. “That leaves us with Hestia. But I’m not convinced Farj is a killer.”

“He doesn’t have to be. What if a third party acted out of self-interest?” Lupe paused and stared at Araci. “Just a minute,” she said. She waved up a search window in her visor and concentrated. With a slight nod, she shared the results with Araci.

Araci saw Lupe’s search. It started with Dakota’s resume. It jumped to her previous ransomware employer. A hop over to corporate relationships produced an organization tree. On the tree, the ransomware company was highlighted, as was the line leading up the tree to the parent, then down a branch - which led to Hestia.

“Dakota was reverse-engineering intellectual property belonging to a sibling of her previous employer,” Lupe pointed out. “Whether she knew it, she was messing around with a relative of a ransomware company - a company with flexible ethics, and a company that knew where to find her. Farj might not have pulled the trigger, but he knew people that would.”

“For that, I’m buying tonight’s drinks,” said Araci. “It fits. All that’s left to do is mountains of paperwork, but I think you’re on-target.”

// -----

At home, Araci was helping the robot vacuum when his visor announced a call. It was from someone using a privacy puppet.

“Hello Robin,” answered Araci. “Is there something new you’d like to discuss?”

“This isn’t Robin,” said the puppet. “I want to help you review your assumptions about Dakota Williams and Robin Lopez.”

"That a rather ominous threat." Whoever was driving this animation had access to luxurious bandwidth. Robin’s puppet had been featureless. In comparison, this was a middle-age woman with astonishing detail in her face and hair. She dressed conservatively, but in current fashion. Sometimes puppets only rendered from the waist up; this was a full-body complete with sensible shoes.

“I don’t suppose you’d like to share your contact information?” asked Araci, knowing the anonymous caller would not do so.

She laughed, then leaned against the table. *How do they know there is a table?* thought Araci. 

“I’m an associate of Hestia - from Montevideo - a former employer of Dakota Williams. You’ve sent Hestia a summons, and I’ve got some alternatives for you to consider.”

“I’m not willing to discuss this with an anonymous caller. There are legal channels Hestia should be following.”

“Hestia lawyers are preparing a response. Before that happens, I’m going to help you get back on the right track.”

“Well, I’ve got a lot of important things to do today.” Araci considered the vacuum cleaner. “But I’m always interested in a mystery. Is this going to cost me?”

The woman chuckled. “No cost,” she said. “You need to consider the meal Dakota was playing with. Unfortunately, there isn’t enough of it left for you to examine. If you don’t already know, it was from WorldFood and you can’t buy them. In fact, you can’t even steal them anymore. They hurridly pulled them out of testing. If you could obtain one, you would have to hire some high-powered electrical engineers and some equally high-powered food engineers, then do months of research to figure out what’s unusual about it.”

The woman produced a meal kit from... somewhere. It was a virtual sleight-of-hand, if such a thing could exist.

“Fortunately, our mutual corporate parent has done this. And they’d like to slow down WorldFood’s progress. Since WorldFood is responsible for Dakota’s death, we'd like you to pursue a murder charge against them. You could drop the summons to Hestia as well."

Araci sent the robot off to the kitchen. “You’re making a lot of claims, and you tell me I don’t have the wattage to check your work. I’ll state the obvious; why should I trust you?”

“Because we’ve sent you one of the kits. When you get it, you’ll be able to prove what I’m about to show you.” She held the meal in front of Araci. It doubled in size, then became transparent. It was a starburst pattern of food cavities, channels, pumps, valves, and electronics. A chip throbbed with a blue outline.

“This chip, the one outlined in blue light, is a new concept for meals. It’s full-blown artificial intelligence. It doesn’t make the meal sing or dance. It just solves problems - like any other AI. But it does two special things: first, it confirms the food preparation process is going according to plan. If not, it adjusts the recipe to recover. Second, it sends that learning back to the WorldFood server.”

Araci sat down. The woman puppet took a step closer and also sat, a chair materializing under her. A perfectly smooth animation and Araci forgot he was talking to thin air. 

“I assume Hestia meals also communicate back to the network.”

“True. But Hestia only collects the bare minimum. Privacy laws restrict what can be recorded. WorldFood made a questionable dodge around the restriction. They don’t record the actions from the user; they record the actions of the AI. The AI is responding to the oven and the user. See the difference?”

“I understand. It sounds like something a judge would be interested in discussing.”

“Try Congress and legislation,” she said. “This is a game changer and not just for food.”

“Sounds like a job for your lobbyist. I’m only interested in what - or who - blew up Dakota.”

The puppet put the meal back to wherever it had appeared from. “It’s the AI. We can’t test it. But we’re certain when Dakota put this meal in the oven, the AI tried to control things. The oven didn’t respond predictably, so the AI improvised. Somehow the AI decided it needed to open the gas valve. But the gas valve was already open. Dakota’s custom oven chip wasn't reliably reporting the state of the oven and gave the AI inaccurate information."

She opened up a window with a diagram of AI logic. None of it made sense to Araci, but it was something he could provide to the Police programming team.

"Somehow, the oven filled with gas. It probably spilled out into the room. The AI didn’t know, so it lit the oven. WorldFood’s testing was not as careful as it should be. If they release these meals they’re going to cause consumers to question the safety of the Hestia oven. That’s bad for profits.”

“And we’ll be able to test this when the meal shows up?”

She stood up. “Yes, you’ll be able to confirm what I’ve told you. And when you do, we would appreciate it if you pulled the summons from Hestia and sent it to WorldFood instead.”

Araci pondered. “I don’t make deals without evidence. How do I contact you when - or if - we confirm?”

“We’ll know. We’re watching the AI and can see what it communicates. Oh, and one more thing.”

Araci scratched his chin. Always one more thing. “What is it?”

“The scenario I just told you about is one of several. It’s the scenario with the highest probability. But there is another with a high likelihood. It could be the AI was instructed to protect its intellectual property. The AI may have recognized Dakota’s attempt to reverse engineer the meal and took a defensive action.”

“You’re saying the meal blew up the oven to prevent Dakota from learning how it worked?”

“Self-destruct options are a standard part of military devices. Why not consumer goods? Like I said, this isn’t the strongest probability - but it’s very possible. Self-immolation would be a quick and easy way to prevent someone from finding how a meal is built. In any case - you might want to take precautions.”

She winked out of existence, leaving Araci alone in the room.
