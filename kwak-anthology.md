Two decades after the earthquake, downtown Portland is almost cleared of debris. New buildings rise to optimistic heights and the Willamette river flows to the Columbia. Detective Araci Belo considered the view for a full half-minute, then shifted his focus back to the shattered glass. The room he stands in is on the 33rd floor of a luxury condominium built by the city. The hope is to attract new business and dispel the perception of Portland as a disaster zone. 

An explosion had propelled bits of the oven from the back of the condominium. Nothing had broken through the window. They were earthquake-proof, designed not to shred the pedestrians below with lethal glass daggers. Despite the cracks and bulls-eyes, they were the most intact feature of this room.

Besides Araci, there were two fire inspectors, a police imaging technician  ("Lupe"), two appliance maintenance people, a condo maintenance administrator, and her assistant. Three home owners’ association board members and neighbors on all sides of this condo stood in the hallway.

The coppery, sweet, meaty smell of burnt flesh emanated from Dakota Williams, the recently deceased occupant of the condominium. She lay on her back in the middle of the room; her severed right arm near the earthquake pillar. Her left forearm lay near the door. The explosion had burned through her clothing and flesh and propelled bits of face, hair, and scalp to the broken window. 

Araci stepped around Dakota and through the door to his left. This opened to the bedroom and a small bathroom. The bathroom was tidy, but not spotless. There were two toothbrushes in a cup. Before Araci could access the medical records kept by the bathroom mirror, he'd need a privacy waiver. He filed the request, but it would be days before department lawyers could get it cleared.

Araci pulled up Dakota's publicly shared space, which included pictures of her in Montevideo, always smiling, often in the middle of a plaza. In a video dated January 2059, a boy named Robin Lopez appeared. Araci traced Robin back to Portland, Oregon. He had visited Montevideo for an open source software convention. That spring, there were videos of Dakota boarding a plane to Portland for a long weekend. A month later Robin returned to Montevideo, with several videos at Playa de Los Pocitos in daylight - dancing at night. The videos became more playful and intimate, leading up to Dakota's move to Portland. 

Araci could request a DNA test, but Robin Lopez owned the second toothbrush. His absence in this room was a gaping hole in the narrative. He wasn't a man of mystery; he had his own complete internet story. But he picked an interesting moment to go missing. Araci made a note to find him.

To be complete, he attached a summary of Dakota's history to the case file. She had recently moved here from Montevideo, Uruguay, leaving behind an electrical engineer position with a publicly held ransomware company. Her resume listed a current affiliation with "Abundancy," a non-profit involved in food distribution.

Electronic parts cluttered the small desk; the things an Electronics Engineer might use.

"The scan is ready," said Officer Guadalupe Reyes. She pushed a few buttons on the back of a camera. "I've put the render in the report folder. You interested in grabbing some dinner tonight?" 

*Guadalupe* - sometimes "Lupe" - was Araci's sparring partner in the Portland Police Self-Defense class. Their relationship was professional, although there were signals something more might be possible. 

"Not tonight," replied Araci. "Callista is leaving for another year in Mississippi and has promised to make dinner before she leaves. She's trying to make up for asking me to babysit her bird. Dinner tomorrow?"

Lupe smiled. "Dinner tomorrow, then." She grabbed her bags and pushed through the crowd. 

Araci retrieved the scan in his visor and re-surveyed the room, comparing the two overlaid views; the real, burned room, and the room as shown in blueprints. An augmented reality outline filled in the missing parts of the destroyed counter. The oven, what little remained, had an overlay of the real oven before the explosion. All that remained was the back plane, stove, and fuel tank. The tank had burned, but was intact and at a crazy angle. Everything splayed outwards from the oven cavity; the explosion had clearly occurred there. 

The oven, a "Hestia" model, was easy to install and use. It had no controls, no dials. Instructions from the meal packet controlled it. Each meal was packaged in a multi-chambered cook plate with valves driven by a micro controller; part of the meal packet. The chambers contained ingredients. The controller opened valves at the proper time, communicating with the oven for temperature change. Just place a meal kit in the oven and stand back. Normally it produced a perfect dinner, but this time, Hestia had taken an angry turn for the worst.

Lupe's scan allowed for an animated reconstruction of the explosion, tracing the path of all parts back to their original assembly. Araci played it forward and reverse three times; most of the oven appeared in place, but some parts were marked as errors in position, probably because of online blueprints being out-of-date.

What happened was clear. The oven exploded. Dakota had been standing in front, possibly opening the door, when the thing unexpectedly distributed a high-velocity cloud of sharp plastic, metal, and glass shrapnel through her and into the room.

As for this condo, there was nothing more. He shipped the report to the Portland Police server and left the apartment clean-up to the forensics team.

"HUMAN ERROR," screeched Rifkin. The African Gray parrot belonged to Callista Belo, Araci's daughter. Araci agreed to care for the bird while his daughter handled disaster relief in Mississippi. Rifkin's previous owner had watched a lot of *2001 - A Space Odyssey* and Rifkin communicated with random quotes from the movie and always at full volume. 

Callista was making dinner. Spaghetti in a packet, boil and serve. The spaghetti was in a separate package from the sauce - which made it special. The salad and wine made it almost as good as his mother created in their antique kitchen.

"Did you ever consider one of those new ovens?" asked Araci. "They don't need gas lines anymore. There's a propane tank built-in."

"Dad, that's a luxury item I can't afford," she replied. "I'm too busy to fuss around with one of those things. Besides, those manufacturer-sanctioned cook packets are expensive. It's not like you can just whip up some batter and bake a cake. Buy the specific tray for whatever it is you want to cook - and it has to be compatible with your oven. You can't buy a bread kit from Red Mill and expect it to work with an oven that isn't red-mill-certified. It's so much easier with boil and serve pouches. Cheaper too."

"Probably safer," said Araci. He forked up spaghetti, fending off Rifkin from his plate. It was easier to give Rifkin run of the apartment. The alternative was to lock him into his cage and endure deafening complaints. "I just saw the result from one of those things exploding. Killed the occupant."

"That's not supposed to happen," she said. "Everything I read says they are safe as tissue paper. Was it arson?"

"Arson is always possible," he said. "But you can't rule out human ingenuity. Who's to say the victim didn't warm up some petroleum based beauty product at the same time as making dinner. Dumber things happen."

"Do you know anything about the victim? Was it an accident?"

"I don't know her net worth, but she had a fancy apartment with a luxury oven. She was a programmer, recently moved here from Montevideo. Used to work for a publically held ransomware company. Looks to be social from her online profile, but not sure how long-term any of those relationships are."

"I thought ransomware was outlawed?"

"Not necessarily," Araci said. He pushed his plate to Rifkin, who grabbed a noodle and flew into the other room. Spaghetti sauce dripped behind, nothing was clean with Rifkin. "Ransomware is a messy business, but when it goes public, it has shareholder value. Mutual funds have political sway, and profits talk. Big Pharm made big money on opioids and made money for shareholders. Same with ransomware. Worry not about the careless corporate victim, insurance covers the cost. She was from Uruguay where it is all very respectable and can be a resume builder."

"So she moves, then dies in a freak accident. That's not suspicious?"

"Point taken," says Araci. "Could be she was escaping from something. Could be someone was unhappy about her departure. Could be her next move was not approved by her previous employer. Possibly a jealous boyfriend. Possibly an international cartel. All I have is a burned out condominium and a smoking corpse."

"You didn't mention what she was doing when the oven exploded. Was there a cook package? Probably in bits - but there must have been some parts left lying around."

Araci had already reviewed the scans. Replaying the reconstruction on the way to dinner, Araci had identified the victim's last intended meal. It was a non-standard specialty version of Chicken Marsala. Not available in grocery stores, at least not this version. This meal was entirely outside of the public distribution chain. Dakota's move from a dicey ransomware company coupled with her quick demise from a non-standard tray of Chicken Marsala was one coincidence too many.

Araci swept up bird trash. Again. Rifkin had been his roommate for less than a day, and it was a constant. Araci did it when he was thinking, a mindless activity for his body so he could think about other things.

The more he found out about Robin Lopez, the more interesting he became. Robin was the author of "The Road To Food Free From Restrictions," written with guidance from the Free Software Foundation. The book outlined how industry could and should take part in keeping food a basic human right. This included the manufacturer of Dakota's hazardous oven, although appliance manufacturers were adamant they needed profits for research and development of new life-saving products.

Robin worked with Abundancy, the same non-profit Dakota listed as her current project. Love and philanthropy often traveled together.

However, Abundancy had been accused of some violent activism. They hadn't gone as far as claiming responsibility for breaking windows at Hestia factories, slashing tires of delivery vehicles, or the small-time arson at showrooms. They had disrupted shareholder meetings and sent letters just shy of threatening bodily harm. There was a dark side to Abundancy, and it seemed possible Robin was not the intelligent pacifist Dakota had followed to Portland.

"I AM PUTTING MYSELF TO THE FULLEST POSSIBLE USE!" screeched Rifkin. Rifkin had pried open the door of his cage and was heading to the kitchen. Araci followed a minute later to observe the bird ripping apart a box of crackers. The floor vac robot was already in motion and Araci resignedly observed the bird and the vacuum fight it out.

Leaving the kitchen ruckus of vacuum vs bird, Araci retreated to the living room. If Robin was fighting with Hestia's manufacturers, what was Dakota doing with the unit in her apartment? Robin's toothbrush was testimony he knew about the stove. Was Dakota's death the unexpected result of a lover's argument? The flower of affection got lost in arguments about minutia and lovers had killed lovers because of the way they chewed food, cheated at cards, or felt about religion, politics, or family.

Dakota herself wasn't an innocent. Working for a ransomware corporation might look corporate but in the end, it was about fraud. IT managers lost their jobs because of ransomware. CEOs were asked to step down. Stock prices fell. Customer data was enslaved and sold to less scrupulous operators. Dakota knew this and still accepted a paycheck. Did her past catch up in a sudden fashion?

Araci reviewed the file. Abundancy - which advocated food free of restrictions connected Dakota and Robin.

"Rifkin, who would object to free food?" Araci spoke to the bird, but expected little a response. In fact, Rifkin was destroying a piece of the carpet and couldn't be bothered. No matter, Araci already knew one villain; Hestia's manufacturer. 

Araci's call to Hestia's manufacturer was met with an artificially intelligent receptionist, projected through his visor as sitting across from him at the table. 

"Hello Araci Belo," said the receptionist. "I'm here to help." The receptionist exhibited artificial signs of life, but waited, saying nothing more.

"I'd like to speak to the Hestia Product Manager," replied Araci. 

The receptionist didn't hesitate. "I'm sorry, but our product managers are only available by appointment. Can I connect you with our media department?"

"No. I'm with the Portland Police Department and I'm working on a case involving one of your Hestia ovens. I'd like to speak with the product manager of the Hestia Oven." Araci enunciated and spoke slowly, emphasizing the words 'Police' and 'Hestia.'

"One minute please." the receptionist paused, then faded to black. In their place appeared a dark-haired, middle-age man. He looked up and adjusted something on his desk.

"Hello Mr. Belo. My name is Farj Abdalla. I'm told you have some questions." Farj waved his hand from off-screen to the center of his view, adding two more individuals to the call. "This is Ms. Broin, our attorney, and Mr. Nilsson, who manages media relations for the Hestia Ovens. Since you are a police representative, this call is recorded. Do you object?"

The prickly reception did not surprise Araci. He'd used his police status to get the receptionist to act, but knew it would put everyone on guard. 

"I'm investigating the death of Dakota Williams..." 

Araci hadn't finished speaking, but Broin the attorney immediately searched for something. She tapped Farj and pointed to whatever she had found. It was invisible to Araci. Dakota must already have a history with the company.

Farj muted and turned to Nilsson, then Broin, conferred for a minute, then returned to Araci.

"Dakota Williams is a member of Abundancy. We support the idea of unrestricted food for all and have issued several statements regarding our desire to work with Abundancy to accomplish this within the bounds of our corporation's abilities." 

Farj spoke this line with no hesitation. He had practiced it before; this was not the first time he had to address issues with the Abundancy group. Araci wondered if the AI receptionist knew the line as well.

Araci tried again. "I understand you might have issues with Abundancy, but I'm more interested in trying to sort out some issues related to an explosion of one of your devices."

In spite of expressing disinterest, Araci made notes; Farj, Broin, and Nilsson knew Dakota Williams. They knew she was working with Abundancy. Most importantly, they didn't act surprised to hear of her death. They either had a search on Dakota and had turned up a police report, or they had killed her themselves. The former was likely, the latter would be interesting. Araci decided to pursue a hunch.

"I'm also investigating the death of Robin Lopez. They seem to be related."

Farj again muted and conferred, then answered Araci. "We can't speculate on the relationship between Ms. Williams and Mr. Lopez. We know Ms. Williams owns a Hestia Oven, but that unit has not responded to our pings for several weeks. Ms. Williams has refused to allow us to provide maintenance, so we aren't liable for any resulting malfunction."

"What have you heard about the malfunction?" asked Araci. "Have you determined the cause?"

"We had a maintenance team on site and I'm able to supply you with their report," said Farj. "They noted you were there. I suspect you found the same as our team; the oven wasn't intact and it was difficult to recover a significant amount of the pieces. Obviously we're interested in what happened, but aren't ready to share any conclusions at this time."

"So right now, you don't know what happened?"

"Correct," answered Farj. "We don't know what happened. When we do know, we will be happy to share those findings."

Araci made sure they had his contact information, then ended the call. Hestia wasn't going to provide any more information so it didn't make sense to keep asking. He would need more details before speaking with them again.

// -----

Abundancy was Araci's only connection to Lopez and Williams. Hestia was also aware of the organization. They seemed to be central to something. Araci spent the better part of an hour trying to make contact with an actual person; Abundancy was shielded behind layers of call handlers that were unwilling to provide access to a real person.

It wasn't until he challenged one of the AIs with a non-specific police action that he made any progress. Legally, he couldn't do anything, but he must have used the right combination of keywords. A human appeared, but their face was obscured with a synthesized privacy mask.

"Detective Araci, we're not stupid. Please don't threaten us with legal action you can't follow up on," said whoever was behind the mask. "However, since you're investigating what happened to Dakota and Robin, I want to make sure you're aware of all the facts."

"I recently spoke to the Hestia manufacturers," said Araci. "They mentioned your organization."

"I'm sure they did. They are using Dakota as an example of why food needs to be patented. Their oven is built to work with their food trays - and only their food trays. First they control the seed, then they control the harvest, then they control the preparation. It's proprietary food from field to consumer, locking out anyone who wants to do it themselves."

"That's interesting, but I'm only concerned about Dakota and Robin. Were they working on something related to Abundancy?"

"They may have been reverse-engineering the oven and food API. But that's Hestia intellectual property and I can't condone illegal behavior. But I can suggest you look at the financial impact if Hestia were to lose control of their food system. It might be worth killing someone. Not that corporations have ever done anything evil or illegal."

"I appreciate your theories. When you're ready to speak face to face, please feel free to contact me." Araci terminated the call. 

Would a corporation kill to protect intellectual property? Of course they would.

Araci's visor announced a request from Lupe, which he gladly accepted. "Araci, we're finding some interesting details in the scan of the condominium explosion. It takes some pretty high resolution, you might want to come over to the media lab and take a look."

// -----

The police media lab wasn't much more than a room with desks and high-resolution monitors. The striking feature was the glass wall with a view of the servers. Privacy laws dictated this type of data be controlled and under actual lock and key. Humans and their nasty organic residue weren't allowed in with the computers. So Araci had to come visit in person.

"We had the render machines spend some quality time with the scans of the room and found this interesting difference from the original view." Lupe controlled the displays. One shown a programming interface, another showed the rendered output. She was displaying a view of the scan Araci had been viewing earlier, but in much higher resolution.

"There are two things you should see," said Lupe. She could have manipulated the view through the code interface, but chose to use hand gestures instead. "Let's start with the oven reconstruction."

Lupe waved the room into view, then spread her hands to enlarge the space where the oven used to be. Spinning her fingers in a counter-clockwise motion brought a flood of oven parts back into view, re-assembling the oven to it's assumed state before the explosion.

Lupe stopped the motion. "Okay, look right here. Do you see the circuits coming back together?"

Lupe pointed at a green circuit board appearing in the back of the oven. Parts were missing; the reconstruction could only do so much and chose not to fill in missing data.

"This isn't the standard Hestia circuit board. Someone built and installed a home-built version."

"Can you move to the scan of the bedroom desk," asked Araci.

The view stepped back from the oven, turned, and glided to the bedroom. "Move to the equipment on the desk, please."

When Araci had physically been in the room, he had seen these circuit boards and electronics. They were visible in the render currently being shown, with the addition of tags identifying the parts.
