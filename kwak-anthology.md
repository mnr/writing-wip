Downtown Portland was almost cleared of debris. Two decades after the earthquake, new buildings were rising to optimistic heights and the river was again flowing. Detective Araci Belo considered the view for a full half-minute, then shifted his focus back to the shattered glass between him and downtown. 

This building was one of the two luxury condominiums built by the city. The hope was to attract new business and to dispell the perception of Portland as a disaster zone. Which it actually was - or had been.

Araci liked Portland. Aside from the constant re-construction, it was clean and friendly. It didn't smell and transportation had been planned for efficient travel. Most other cities were a scribble of roads, rails, and bike paths placed around existing buildings.

The room he stood in was unlike Portland in every way. An explosion had propelled improvised missles from the back of the condominium towards the window. None had broken through. The windows were earthquake-proof, designed not to shred the pedestrians below with lethal glass daggers. Despite the cracks and bulls-eyes, they were the most intact feature of this room.

There were more people in this room than it was intended to host. Two fire inspectors, a police imaging technician, two appliance maintenance people, a condo maintenance administrator, and her assistant all tried not to disturb the chaos. Three home owners association board members and neighbors on all sides of this condo stood in the hallway.

The coppery, sweet, meaty smell of burnt flesh emanated from Dakota Williams, the recently deceased occupant of the condominium. She lay on her back in the middle of the room, her right arm near the earthquake pillar, severed at the shoulder. Her left forearm lay near the door. Bits of face, hair, and scalp were stuck to the broken window. The explosion had burned through her clothing and flesh.

Araci stepped around Dakota and through the door to his left. This showed the bedroom and a small bathroom. The bathroom was tidy, but not spotless. There were two toothbrushes in a cup. Before Araci could access the medical records kept by the bathroom mirror he'd need a privacy waiver. He filed the request, but it would be days before department lawyers could get it cleared.

Dakota's internet trail included pictures of her in Montevideo, always smiling, often in the middle of a plaza. In a video dated January 2059, a boy named David Lopez appeared. David lived in Portland, Oregon and was in Montevideo for an open source software convention. Three weeks later, Dakota travelled to Portland for a long weekend. Five weeks later David returned to Montevideo, with several videos at Playa de Los Pocitos in daylight and dancing at night. The videos became more playful and intimate, leading up to Dakota's trip to Portland. 

David Lopez most certainly owned the second toothbrush. His absence was a gaping hole in the narrative. He wasn't a man of mystery, he had his own complete internet story. But he picked an interesting moment to go missing. Araci made a note to find him.

The bed was ruffled and a few kitchen items thrown in by the explosion. A small desk was cluttered with electronics parts and tools, the sorts of things an Electronics Engineer might use.

The wall running through the center of the condo had directed the blast in one direction - like a cannon - towards the external wall. Two body parts had bounced off the earthquake pillars, leaving blood at the impact points. The sprinklers hadn't removed all the evidence.

"The scan is ready," said Officer Guadalupe Reyes. She pushed a few buttons on the back of a camera. "I've put the render in the report folder. You interested in grabbing some dinner tonight?" 

*Guadalupe* - sometimes "Lupe" - was Araci's sparring partner in the Portland Police Self-Defense class. Their relationship was professional, although there were signals something more might be possible. 

"Not tonight," replied Araci. "Callista is leaving for another year in Mississippi and has promised to make dinner before she leaves. She's trying to make up for asking me to babysit her bird. Dinner tomorrow?"

Lupe smiled. "Dinner tomorrow, then." She grabbed her bags and pushed through the crowd. 

Araci engaged the scan in his visor and re-surveyed the room. The semi-transparent image of the counter filled in the missing parts of the real counter. There was less of the real oven; all that remained was the back plane, stove, and fuel tank. The tank was burned, but intact, but at a crazy angle from where it was supposed to be. Everything splayed outwards from the oven cavity where the explosion had clearly occured. Behind the oven the wall had a shallow crater.

The oven, a "Hestia" model, was designed to be easy to install and use. The oven was actually controlled by instructions from the meal it was cooking. Each meal was packaged in a multi-chambered cook plate with valves driven by a microcontroller on the underside of the meal. The chambers contained ingredients, the controller opened valves at the proper time, communicating with the oven for temperature adjustment. Hestia had no knobs or buttons; just place a meal kit in the oven and stand back. Hestia had taken an angry turn for the worst.

The scan allowed for an animated reconstruction of the explosion, tracing the path of scattered oven parts back to their original assembly. Araci played it forward and reverse three times; some parts were marked as errors in position, probably due to online blueprints being out-of-date.

Araci attached a summary of Dakota's history to the case file. She had recently moved here from Montevideo, Uruguay, leaving behind an electrical engineer position with a publically-held ransomware company. Her resume listed a current affiliation with "Abundancy," a non-profit involved in food distribution.

What happened was clear. The oven exploded. Dakota had been standing in front of the oven, possibly opening the door when the thing unexpectedly distributed a high-velocity cloud of sharp plastic, metal, and glass shrapnel through her and into the room.

As to this condo, there was nothing more. He shipped the report to the Portland Police server and left the apartment clean-up to the forensics team.

"HUMAN ERROR," screeched Rifkin. The African Gray parrot belonged to Callista Belo, Araci's daughter. Araci agreed to care for the bird while his daughter handled disaster relief in Mississippi. Rifkin's previous owner had watched a lot of *2001 - A Space Oddessy* and Rifkin communicated with random quotes from the movie. Always at full volume. 

Callista was making dinner. Nothing special. Spaghetti in a packet, boil and serve. The spaghetti was in a separate package from the sauce - which made it special. The salad and wine made it almost as good as his mother created in their antique kitchen.

"Did you ever consider one of those new ovens?" asked Araci. "They don't need gas lines anymore. There's a propane tank built-in."

"Dad, that's a luxury item I can't afford," she replied. "I'm too busy to fuss around with one of those things. Besides, those special cook packets are expensive. It's not like you can just whip up some dough and bake a cake. You have to buy the specific tray for whatever it is you want to cook - and it has to be compatible with your oven. You can't buy a bread kit from Red Mill and expect it to work with an oven that isn't red-mill-certified. It's so much easier with boil and serve pouches. Cheaper too."

"Probably safer as well," said Araci. He forked up spaghetti, fending off Rifkin from his plate. It was easier to give Rifkin run of the apartment. The alternative was to lock him into his cage and endure deafening complaints. "I just saw the result from one of those things exploding. Killed the occupant."

"That's not supposed to happen," she said. "Everything I see says they are as safe as tissue paper. Was it arson?"

"Arson is always possible," he said. "But you can't rule out human ingenuity. Who's to say the victim didn't try to warm up some petroleum based beauty product at the same time as making dinner. Dumber things happen."

"Do you know anything about the victim. Was it an accident?"

"Her name was Dakota Williams. I don't know her net worth, but she had a fancy apartment with a luxury oven. She was a programmer, recently moved here from Montevideo. Used to work for a publically-held ransomware company. Looks to be social from her online profile, but not sure how long-term any of those relationships are."

"I thought ransomware was outlawed?"

"Not necessarily," Araci said. He pushed his plate to Rifkin, who grabbed a noodle and flew into the other room. Spaghetti sauce dripped behind, nothing was clean with Rifkin. "Ransomware is a messy business, but when it goes public, it has shareholder value. Mutual funds have political sway, and profits talk. Big Pharm made big money on opiods and made money for shareholders. Same with ransomware. Worry not about the careless corporate victim, insurance covers the cost. She was from Uruguay where it is all very respectable and can be a resume builder."

"So she moves, then dies in a freak accident. That's not suspicious?"

"Point taken," says Araci. "Could be she was escaping from something. Could be someone was unhappy about her departure. Could be her next move was not approved by her previous employer. Possibly a jealous boyfriend. Possibly an international cartel. All I have is a burned out condominium and a smoking corpse."

"You didn't mention what she was doing when the oven exploded. Was there a cook package? Probably in bits - but there must have been some parts left laying around."

Araci had already reviewed the scans. Replaying the reconstruction on the way to dinner, Araci had identified the victim's last intended meal. The meal was a non-standard speciality version of Chicken Marsala. Not available in grocery stores, at least not this version. It wasn't even a beta release, sometimes available from manufacturers for testing. This meal was entirely outside of the public distribution chain. Dakota's move from a dicey ransomware company coupled with her quick demise from a non-standard tray of Chicken Marsala was one coincidence too many.

Araci swept up bird trash. Again. Rifkin had been his roommate for less than a day, and it was a constant. Araci found himself doing it when he was thinking, a mindless activity for his body so he could think about other things.

The more he found out about David Lopez, the more interesting he became. David was the author of "The road to food free from restrictions," written with guidance from the Free Software Foundation. He outlined how food manufacturers could and should participate in keeping food a basic human right. This included the manufacturer of Dakota's hazardous oven, although they were adamant they needed profits for research and development of new life-saving products.

David worked with Abundancy, the same non-profit Dakota listed as her current project. Love and philanthropy often travelled together.

However, Abundancy had been accused of some violent activism.
